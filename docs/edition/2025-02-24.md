## Upcoming *Zoom* Sessions

All zoom sessions use the same [Zoom link](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89085412738?pwd=eXpTN2M5V3M0TEVJQktmVldBTVRYUT09){:target="_blank"}.

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) zoom meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month.

#### Zoom Calendar

March is tricky: Some folks switch to Daylight Savings Time March 9, others switch to Summer Time March 30 with some countries not changing time and a few changing on different dates. The time listed below is UTC.

*Zoom* Sessions use this link:

## iOS Version Update and Recommendation

iOS 18.3.1 has been tested and given the thumbs up by our team. Please see [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/#ios-updates){:target="_blank"}.

If you have not updated your phone to iOS 18 yet, we recommend that you at least update to iOS 17.7.2 to get the latest security patches.

It is unusual for the Loop developers to support four different iOS Historically, the Loop developers tried to maintain support for the current and one-level-earlier iOS. Be prepared for your iOS 15 and 16 devices to no longer be supported in future releases. We recommend you update to a phone that can support iOS 17 and 18.

These apps currently have these minimum requirements:

* Loop: iOS 15
* Trio 0.2.3: iOS 16
* Trio (closed beta - coming soon): iOS 17
* LoopFollow: iOS 15.6
* LoopCaregiver: iOS 16

If you're still using an iPhone X or earlier, please look for a new device. Get a newer one from a friend/relative who is upgrading or buy one from a resale shop. Compatibility information can be found in [LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/phone/#compatible-device){:target="_blank"}.

## `LoopFollow` News

Do you insert your G7 sensor early to allow it to stabilize while still using the previous sensor? Do you worry that the new sensor might not start the way it's supposed to? It has happened to people - which is why the [magnet trick has been discussed](https://loopandlearn.github.io/news/edition/2024-12-23/#dexcom-g7-pairing-help){:target="_blank"}.

With the *LoopFollow* app, v2.2.9 or later, it’s very easy to check if a G7 sensor wakes up upon insertion. In *LoopFollow*, choose Settings -> Background Refresh Settings -> Dexcom. This will show any new Dexcom device within a few minutes after insertion. This can be useful to confirm  the newly inserted G7 is active and doesn’t require the magnet trick.

**`Trio` + `LoopFollow` Users**: LoopFollow Version 2.2.10 was released on 22 February. The only change from v2.2.9 is that v2.2.10 restores the proper display of Trio prediction lines when following someone using Trio 0.2.3 and earlier. Browser Builders can easily update LoopFollow from a phone or any internet-connected device.

## Connectivity Issues with *Dexcom G7*

There have been a lot of reports that both the *Loop* app and the *Trio* app are not picking up *Dexcom G7* readings even when the *Dexcom* app is working. There is work ongoing to test code that may improve the situation.

## Tech Tips

### Preserve Omnipod Battery During Travel

Insulet shared [helpful instructions](https://www.omnipod.com/current-podders/resources/omnipod-dash/travel-advisory){:target="_blank"} for international travelers who may encounter zones where 2G and 3G service has been shut down.

### Medtronic Pump Pressure Issues

Changes in atmospheric pressure, such as during air travel, can cause unintended insulin delivery due to air bubble expansion or compression in the reservoir, potentially affecting blood glucose levels. [Details of this Safety Alert](https://hcp.medtronic-diabetes.com.au/safety-alerts){:target="_blank"} can be found on Medtronic’s website.

Note: This can happen with other pumps too.

### A Look at LoopDocs

When’s the last time you popped over and read LoopDocs? Here’s a great opportunity- we’ll even include a link! Check out the [Algorithm FAQs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/algorithm-faqs/){:target="_blank"}... and if you have a question you think should be added, let us know on Facebook!  

## Spread the News

We recommend sharing an applicable edition of [News From Loop and Learn](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-and-learn-newsletter/){:target="_blank"} with others when you know of content that may help them- Loopy or otherwise. An example is recent sharing with a non-Looper, who needed G7 help.
