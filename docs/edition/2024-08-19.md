## The `Trio` App is Released

**We are thrilled to share the official release of the *Trio* app!**

A huge thank you goes out to the many talented volunteers who dedicated their time and expertise to bring
you this exciting new option for DIY looping. We also want to express our gratitude to everyone who
participated in the beta testing and patiently awaited this release.

As with all things DIY looping, if you need help with any aspect of the *Trio* app, please reach out to the community for
support. [Trio Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/diytrio){:target="_blank"} and [Trio Discord](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE){:target="_blank"} are the best places to seek help.

[Click to begin building](https://docs.diy-trio.org/operate/build){:target="_blank"} your own *Trio* app - but please - do your research first.

This link takes you to the announcement shared in the [Trio Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/diytrio/posts/1647649782635537/). We've reproduced that announcement below.

### From Team Trio: 

After many months of tireless work, we’re thrilled to announce the official release of
Trio 0.2.0, packed with safety upgrades, bug fixes, and a few new features designed to make
managing your blood glucose levels smoother and more reliable than ever. You may notice the
version number is 0.2.0. That is intentional. This version of Trio is the solid foundation to create
something bigger and better. This is only the beginning.

We could not have done it without the great community of developers, project managers, and crucial team members who came together to exemplify the values of the #WeAreNotWaiting community. We want to thank everyone who has contributed to this app from its history to its present.

At this time, we will transition the Facebook group and page to the Trio Group to fully support the users of the Trio app. We encourage all who have been patiently waiting for the release to build Trio.

#### Here’s what’s new:

**Open-Source for Transparency**: Trio is fully open-source, including Oref, the algorithm behind our predictions and dosing decisions.

**Improved Settings & Safety Guardrails**: We’ve refined the default settings and improved the structure of safety guardrails to keep your health management safe and effective.

**Major Bug Fixes**: A host of critical and non-critical bugs have been squashed to ensure a seamless user experience.

**Seamless Integrations**: We’ve integrated LoopKit Submodules to harmonize Pumps, CGMs, and reporting services with the Loop app. Plus, enjoy Tidepool integration, improved Nightscout integration, and Dexcom One+ support.

**Live Activities**: Stay informed on the go with glucose, delta, and trend data displayed right on your iPhone lock screen and Dynamic Island.

**Community-Driven & Peer-Reviewed**: Every update has been peer-reviewed and thoroughly tested by the amazing Trio developer community. It has undergone additional beta testing to ensure the best chance of identifying and correcting critical issues.

For the full details of all the work done, check out the [Trio 0.2.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/nightscout/Trio/releases/tag/v0.2.0){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, hosted under The Nightscout Foundation.

#### So, what’s next?

The team has been working diligently on many new features to ensure a seamless transition in the next release. Now that Trio 0.2.0 has reached the finish line, the team is ready for the fun part, Trio 1.0.0! Here are a few hints at what we’ve been working on:

**A Completely Redesigned User Interface**

**Faster & More Efficient Performance**: We’ve rewritten storage and calculations to make the app faster, safer, and more battery-friendly.

**Enhanced Nightscout Integration**: Caregivers will love the improved usability and new iOS Shortcuts.

**Simplified Override Features & Settings**: Making the app easier to navigate, with detailed explanations and added safety thresholds.

And More!

#### Thank You

Thank you for giving us the time to fully develop this new release and thoroughly beta test. If you’re interested in contributing, join us on the [Trio Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE){:target="_blank"}.

### Switch to the *Trio* App

To those users who have been waiting while using version 2.3.3, we urge you to build Trio sooner rather than later to take advantage of the issues we have addressed. It's a new app and will not interfere with your *iAPS* app. Once you build it, then at your next pod change or other convenient time, switch to *Trio*. Some settings can be imported from your Nightscout site if you use one. The rest, you can copy over from what you used with iAPS.

## `LoopFollow`: Feature Highlight & Update

Loop Follow has a vast array of alarms, including IOB. You can be alerted if there are boluses above a given size, multiple boluses within a set number of minutes or if the Total IOB for the looper is above a set amount. This can help prevent an inadvertent overdose - or at least alert you that steps need to be taken.

[`LoopFollow 2.2.5`](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases/tag/v2.2.5){:target="_blank"} was released recently and is FULL of great new features! Check it out!

## View Override History in the `Loop` App

Did You Know?

You can look back and see details of Overrides you set within the last 24 hours.

Simply tap the blue "Overrides" button at the bottom of Loop's main screen and scroll to the bottom, where you'll find "History". Tap on that and you're all set!

If you have an override running, you'll need to wait until it is finished, or cancel and restart it if you want to view the history.

## Live Activity & Dynamic Island

Live Activity displays your glucose graph as a widget on your phone’s lock screen so you don't have to unlock your phone to see it. While typical widgets often get stale and show data up to an hour out-of-date, Live Activity widgets are reliably updated every few minutes. Also, if you have an iPhone 14 pro or any type of iPhone 15 or newer, it will put your glucose / trend / delta in your Dynamic Island (at the top of your screen) so you can see it even when you have a different app on your iPhone's screen. This feature is included in Trio and is available via [Customization Select Script](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/){:target="_blank"} for Loop.

## iOS Version Update

We have successfully built Loop-main, Loop-dev, LoopCaregiver, LoopFollow 2.2.5, Trio,
and iAPS 2.3.3 using Xcode 15.4 to an iPhone using iOS 17.6.1. There is no need to rebuild
Loop when you update your iOS, but if you are an Xcode-Mac builder, you should be
sure to keep your Mac updated in case you need an emergency rebuild. Mac OS was
then updated from 14.6 to 14.6.1. Xcode randomly closed twice when building again, but
the builds were successful. If your Xcode crashes after this macOS update, just open it
and try again.

## What are `Keys`?

When building with a browser and using Nightscout, we use two kinds of keys:

* API (Application Programming Interface) keys are needed for Browser Builds.
    * [Set up a secrets reference file](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/intro-summary/#make-a-secrets-reference-file){:target="_blank"}
    * [Download a file with a name that ends in “p8”](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/secrets/#generate-api-key){:target="_blank"}
    * API keys reside in your repository secrets
* APN (Apple Push Notification) keys are used for sending remote commands through Nightscout or Caregiver
    * [Download a different file with a name that also ends in “p8”](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/remote-config/#step-2-apple-push-notifications){:target="_blank"}
    * APN keys reside in your Nightscout Config

Be sure to keep these keys separate - they look much the same once downloaded, so be careful!
Both keys and key IDs are needed for both API and APN.

If you lose you keys or get them mixed up, new keys can be obtained at any time, but then you have to go through the trouble of changing the keys in all the places where they are needed.

## No Pull Requests Please

Be kind to your developers: Do NOT open a Pull Request against LoopKit/LoopWorkspace or nightscout/Trio when you modify your build_loop.yml. Do not open a Pull Request against any LoopKit/submodule if preparing Loop or Trio customizations to submodules for browser build. This will save them a lot of work and enable them to stay focused.
