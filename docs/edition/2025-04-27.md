## `Loop` 3.6 is Here!

### Highlights

* Adds Automatic Certificate Generation and Renewal
* Implements updates to minimize Dexcom G7 outages that were recently reported.

For more details, see [LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/version/releases/#loop-v360){:target="_blank"}.

### If you use Browser Build:

* Please use the [Update/Rebuild with Browser Build LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/bb-update/#how-to-update-or-rebuild){:target="_blank"} page - there are extra
instructions for this update
* There was also a one-time change at GitHub that means you must manually sync your fork (one-time)
and build to get this update
    * If you don't manually update - you will get the [Check Update and Keep Alive](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/bb-errors/#check-upstream-and-keep-alive-error){:target="_blank"} error

Because Loop-dev just became Loop-main (3.6), and Loop is under steady innovation, the dev
branch (now 3.7) will continue to be updated.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

Some browser builders have encountered build errors when building Loop 3.6. If that happens
to you, help can be found in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN){:target="_blank"}. 

All Loopers who are not actively engaged in development or testing should use Loop-main.
We expect Loop-dev to become active and experimental once again. Browser builders who
have previously used Loop-dev should [check to ensure](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/build-dev-browser/#change-default-branch){:target="_blank"} that your default branch is set to
Loop-main in GitHub to avoid unexpected updates.

If you use Browser Build, this is a good time to ensure that you have [turned off automatic
installation from TestFlight on the phone](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/phone-install/#disable-automatic-install-from-testflight){:target="_blank"} - you should choose a good time to update.

All new browser builders are encouraged to use a [GitHub organization](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/secrets/#create-a-free-github-organization){:target="_blank"} to expedite browser building.

A very grateful “THANK YOU” to our Loop developers and testers, who work tirelessly to
continuously improve Loop for all of us!

## iOS Version Update

iOS 18.4.1 has been released and
there are no reports of issues.

* See [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/){:target="_blank"} for more info


## Certificate Renawal

These apps have automatic
certificate renewal: `Loop 3.6`, `Trio`,
`LoopFollow`, and `LoopCaregiver`

## Speaker Series: The PBM PRoblem - Insurance Roadblocks to Care

Thank you to [George Huntley](https://www.diabetesleadership.org/who-we-are#leadership){:target="_blank"} of the [Diabetes Leadership Council](https://www.diabetesleadership.org/) and the
[Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition](https://www.diabetespac.org/){:target="_blank"} for an excellent and informative
presentation about insurance issues in the U.S. Here is a [recording of our
interactive session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNgdLgN9YdY){:target="_blank"} and George was kind enough to share his slide deck, which
contains even more info, as well.

## A Loop at `LoopDocs`

Have 5 minutes to kill? Make them count by reading up on what to do to
[stay safe while looping in LoopDocs!](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/safety-faqs/){:target="_blank"}

## Dexcom G6 Availability

We have heard that Edgepark has told some loopers that the G6 was
discontinued and they would have to switch to the G7. Having seen no public
announcement of this, one of our admin called Dexcom and confirmed the
G6 is still being manufactured and the supply issues were resolved.

If you hear something concerning about availability of Dexcom, you can call
the company and check on it yourself at 1-888-738-3646, Option 2. And if
you have issues with your supplier, see if you can switch suppliers.

## Interview with Amy Tendrich

Justin Eastzer interviewed Amy Tenderich, founder of DiabetesMine and
Host of D-Data and Diabetes Innovation days on his podcast this week.

## Survey: Cell Phone Use in Schools

**Parents of students with T1D:**

> How is cell phone use for diabetes monitoring
handled at your child's school?

FOLLOWT1Ds invites you to take a short,
anonymous [survey](https://dqa.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d4gONAaZ70B1WcK?fbclid=IwY2xjawJ6ggZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFwYnRnMDRzV0ZXampMRjZhAR5DjHUYTdH9e-XeJsXbdeEcE6B_4OnL2quX9khEbAy37sgkfLHxBeuXiIOBSA_aem_rlruYLl6nsF_jbiKz28hxA){:target="_blank"} about your child's
experience. With new federal efforts to restrict
cell phones in schools, it's vital to advocate for
clear exceptions for diabetes care.

## A New Endocrine App

Dana Lewis recently
announced a new version
of her app PERT Pilot for iOS.

Individuals with exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency
(EPI) can use the PERT Pilot
app to log their meals,
track the enzymes they
take, and note how each meal affects them. The app also includes the EPI/PEI Symptom Score (EPI/PEI-
SS), which allows users to monitor symptoms over time by evaluating both
their frequency and severity, helping to identify trends and changes.

PERT Pilot is available for both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pert-pilot/id6448204562){:target="_blank"} and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PERTPilot.PERTPilot&pli=1){:target="_blank"}.

Feedback and feature requests can be sent to Dana+PERTPilot@OpenAPS.org
