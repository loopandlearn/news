## Upcoming Video Conference Sessions

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) virtual meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month and the fourth Saturday of each month.

There is also an 
Italian `Open Mic` on the last Tuesday of each month for iOS and
Android loopers (with Patrick Sonnerat for
AAPS).

## Please Update to iOS 18.6

*Apple* has released several updates, including iOS 18.6, which includes 29
security fixes. These updates are reported to be the final updates before
iOS 26 is released in September/October. As expected, no compatibility
issues have been identified. We have used Xcode 16.4 to successfully build
these apps to an iOS 18.6 phone:


* `Trio` `main` and `dev` branches
* `Loop` `main` (3.6.4) and `dev` branch
* `LoopCaregiver`
* `LoopFollow`
* xDrip4iOS


Remember to turn off iOS Automatic Updates on your looping phone in
iPhone Settings/General/Software Update. You should update as soon as you get the all-clear, but do it while you are awake and able to observe if there is any problem getting your insulin delivery device working again after the iOS update.

## Browser Build: 

Here are two important things for Browser Builders to pay attention to (or ignore).

### Automatic Update & Build

Reminder: 

* Browser Builds automatically
rebuild on the first of every month
* Browser Builds
also automatically rebuild on Wednesdays if
the developer has updated the repository since the previous build


A number of users have reported their builds fail
during the automatic update process due to a
*GitHub* resource issues. To improve the rate of successful builds, the developers have
slightly modified the timing of the
automatic updates. This is true for all the Open-Source AID and support apps.

There is a [table in LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/automatic/#open-source-app-schedule) which 
shows the time at
which each
automatic build is planned in the future. This time shift will happen on your second build after this modification is made to the app in question. The first build uses the existing build time and the new build time won't be in place unti the fork is updated as part of the build process.

**Please** take this opportunity to look at TestFlight:

* If your most recent build expires in 60 days or more, there is no need for manual action

* If your most recent build expires in less than 60 days, you should `sync your fork` and build your app

If you would like someone to look at your build logs, please provide your GitHub username, the app(s) you want to build 
and we'll take a look at your build logs.

**Important**: Because of the automatic build failure, it is possible *GitHub* will disable your build action. If that happens to you, you must manually enable it again to get automatic builds to resume.

* [Manual Enable Build, if it is disabled](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/bb-errors/#manual-enable-for-build-action-may-be-required)

### *Apple* Age Rating Questionnaire

Many of our members have asked how/whether to
respond to the *Apple* Age Rating Questionnaire email. For now, we believe that DIY
loopers do not need to take any action. 

We use App
Store Connect, but do not distribute via the App Store
(which is what this requirement is about). 

Most of us
distribute via an Internal Testing Group to ourselves, our
spouse, and/or our child(ren). We are not the target
audience of this questionnaire.

## `Loop` v3.6.4 is released

[*Loop* v3.6.4](https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace/releases/tag/v3.6.4) was released on 31 July 2025.

This release:

* provides support for newer European Libre 2 plus sensors (mid 2025 Libre 2 plus EU sensors) 
* adds localization to the LibreTransmitter module
* adjusts build dependencies for G7SensorKit (no functional change)
* shifts the automatic build time from hh:00 to hh:33
    * automatic builds have been running into errors recently
    * this time shift avoids a time when GitHub resources are impacted

## xDrip4iOS: Important Notice

As many of you already know, the public *TestFlight* builds of xDrip4iOS (xDrip4iO5 / xDrip4i5_MD) will stop working soon (or have already). *Apple* rejected the latest update (version 5.8.0), and those builds can no longer be updated or extended.


> These public *TestFlight* builds were joined via shared links and each supported up to 10,000 users. If you’re using one of them, you’ll need to switch to another option to continue using xDrip4iOS.


### What Options Should I Consider?

These two options are probably best:

* Build xDrip4iOS yourself

    > This is the preferred and most stable option — especially if you are already building an Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS AID) app like `Loop`, `Trio` or `iAPS`.

    > You can use your own *Apple* Developer account:

    > * [link to xDrip4iOS docs](https://xdrip4ios.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/build/#how-to-build-xdrip4ios-using-xcode)

* Zukka (App Store release)

    > Zukka is based on the xDrip4iOS code and is now aligned with the core developers. Core features will remain free, and any changes will be communicated in advance. This is only for people who do not need to use xDrip4iOS with their OS-AID app.

    > * [Zukka app link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zukka/id6743448282)


For other options, join the [xDrip4iOS FaceBook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/853994615056838/).

For long-term continuity and control, building the app yourself is the most future-proof solution. The project continues actively, and we’re grateful to all the developers and contributors who keep it evolving.

## A Look at `LoopDocs`

Do you have trouble understanding `LoopDocs`?  Perhaps you’re reading it
in the wrong language.  `LoopDocs` is readable in many different
languages.  [Take a look!](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/translate/)

## `Loop and Learn` at `Friends for Life`

Loopers had a great time
at our meet-up during
Friends for Life (FFL)
Orlando in July 2025! Thanks to
all who came out to
socialize and talk looping.
It’s always fun to meet
fellow OS-AID users IRL (in real life)!


Several of the admin team and family members,
as well as other community members, also got
together for some “FFL reunion” time.


Rebecca and Reese were dressed in costume for
this year’s Superheros theme!

More about FFL in our next edition.

## Pregnancy and `T1D` Research Opportunity

Are you pregnant and living with `T1D`? You may be eligible to
participate in [an important study](https://www.mountsinai.org/clinical-trials/t1d-pregnancy-me) to help better understand
T1D during pregnancy and improve outcomes. This is a remote
study conducted by Mount Sinai.

## Advocacy in Action: `FOLLOW T1D` gets a Big Win

The US Department of Justice protects `T1D` rights again!
The US Attorney's office for the Western District of
Washington State reached a settlement with a public
school district that once again confirms remotely
monitoring students’ CGMs is a reasonable
accommodation that schools must provide to comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If it's true for
one state it's true for all states under federal law!


If your local schools still refuse to remotely monitor
CGMs of their students, provide them with the letter on
[this page](https://followt1ds.org/doj-mandates) to compel them to FOLLOWT1Ds and FOLLOW
Federal Laws. If they still refuse, contact [FOLLOWT1Ds!](https://followt1ds.org/)
