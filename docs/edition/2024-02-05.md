## February Food Events

We have 3 big events in February that center around food.

### Chinese New Year

While we don’t have Chinese New Year specific articles, the principles in our Super Bowl and Valentine’s Day articles apply. Lots of carbohydrates are consumed and often, lots of fat.

### Super Bowl LVIII

Kick off is at 6:30 p.m. ET/ 3:30 p.m. PT on Sunday, 11 February. Here are some great tips to help manage your blood glucose while you enjoy the [Super Bowl Party](https://www.loopandlearn.org/big-game/). Go, Team!

### Valentine's Day

Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate... and a few other indulgences... this is what many of us enjoy around [Valentine’s Day, 14 February](https://www.loopandlearn.org/vday/). We’ve got you covered!

## New Shortcut to Log a *Nightscout* Treatment

A new shortcut, [Treat](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d757898ce5284de08bcc39cbe07aee3d?fbclid=IwAR0HnlJPAxZtJK3XYDpTxCo1-DDlsUCTwrnc03pGAS_4fDt9goNBYLgQKhk), specifically crafted for children and/or their caregivers, is now available. With this shortcut, low blood sugar treatments can be logged as a **note** in *Nightscout* directly from an iPhone, *Apple* Watch or *Siri*. This is especially important when treatments are not recorded in the *Loop*/*iAPS* app. (There are cases when users do not want the treatment logged in the app but those monitoring remotely need to know if low glucose has been treated.) The **note** is visible in *Nightscout*, facilitating remote monitoring by parents and caregivers. This enhances T1D management communication, helps in identifying treatment patterns, and can help indicate the need for adjustments in diabetes management settings.

To use (once you install it):

* On iPhone: Find the shortcut in the Shortcuts app and tap to run it.
* On Apple Watch: Add the shortcut to your watch face or the Shortcuts app and tap to execute it.
* Via Siri: Activate by saying “Hey Siri, log low treatment” or a custom phrase set during the shortcut setup.

When setting up this shortcut, you’ll be asked to enter:

* *Nightscout* Website Address: The full URL of your *Nightscout* site (e.g., https://yoursite.herokuapp.com), where the shortcut will log treatment entries
* API_SECRET for *Nightscout*: The API_SECRET (password) for the *Nightscout* site, be sure to enter it without trailing spaces
* Your Name: The name of the user (child with T1D or caregiver) for identification in treatment logs

Important Note:

Information logged via this shortcut is visible on your *Nightscout* site as a **note** and can be viewed with compatible apps like LoopFollow, without affecting the *Loop*/*iAPS* app operations.

> This shortcut is based on contributions by Katie DiSimone and Daniel Mini Johansson.

If you have never used shortcuts before, refer to [*LoopDocs* Shortcuts](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/remote-commands/#shortcuts).

## Lock Your Phone

* Lock your phone before you put it in your pocket, purse or backpack so that no accidental button pushes will occur
* Be sure to lock your phone after delivering a bolus, so that you won’t accidentally cancel it
* Check back to make sure boluses or other actions you have taken went to completion

## Check Your Battery

[Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) is one of our recommended apps. It has many useful features, including a wide array of alarm capabilities - great for T1D kids, caregivers and T1D adults! 

We want to be sure you know that it uses a lot of battery and recommend that you check your usage often and be sure to charge your phone more often when using it.
