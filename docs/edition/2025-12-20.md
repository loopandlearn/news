## Great Tips on Loop and Learn Instagram and Facebook

We have lots of great tips and reminders for use during Hanukkah and the rest of the holidays. You can find them- and more to come- by clicking the links to our [IG](https://www.instagram.com/loopandlearn/) and [FB](https://www.facebook.com/groups/loopandlearn) pages.

## Announcement from Nightscout Board

We at the Nightscout Foundation are thrilled to add Tim Gunn and Theresa Hastings to the team! Theresa’s focus will be Events & Community Development, and Tim’s focus will be Development - Community & Software. The progress made in the last two years in the community is a solid sign that #WeAreNotWaiting, and the donations to make the past six hackathons a success are the proof. Thank you one and all for your efforts in combating the beast that is T1D, and especially for your efforts in paying it forward in order for the next solutions and innovations to arrive sooner, rather than later. Here’s to 2026

-Wes Ton, Vice President, Nightscout Foundation

## More from Hackathon 2025

The energy around shaping the future of OS-AID is high! Developers from around the globe worked together, closed some gaps between Android and iOS efforts, defined some common goals and pledged to work towards those goals.
The closing presentations offered an inspiring look at the passion, innovation, and collaboration shaping the future of OS-AID technology. What follows is a summary of the updates shared by some participants, offering a snapshot of current work across the community.

James Wedding opened the reflections by challenging us to reconsider what #WeAreNotWaiting means going forward. With algorithms now “good enough,” he urged the community to think bigger: expanding access globally, to new places where these tools could transform lives.
Several contributors echoed that theme of scale and impact. Bill discussed ongoing work to expand access throughout British Columbia, while Matthieu shared progress on a new system built with machine learning at its core. Rhys celebrated his one-year diaversary and described his effort to rewrite Nightscout in C# with full type safety. The new version will support a seamless transition for users by maintaining compatibility with the existing interface.

A number of updates focused on improving real-world usability. Dana highlighted a data-analysis project on long-duration exercise, exploring how reduced insulin needs persist until calories are replaced. Her question to the community: how can algorithms better adjust for this, and can UAM triggers be improved? James Woglom shared exciting progress reverse-engineering Bluetooth protocols for the Tandem Mobi pump and successfully pairing a Mobi with the Trio system. This brings the development into the next phase where they integrate in all of the commands and build in safety checks.
Others spent the weekend pushing foundational work forward. Dan and Sam continued porting JavaScript to Swift after productive discussions with Dana and Scott and they hope to finalize the Swift port of oref in 2025. They also noted upcoming work involving Medtrum, Eversense, and possibly menstrual-cycle–based ISF dynamics within Trio. Scott reminded the group of underused simulation tools within the oref0 repository that can help analyze marginal BG differences using Nightscout data—powerful resources for improving settings and sensitivity adjustments.

A flurry of smaller but meaningful updates followed: an AndroidAPS contributor demoed connecting the app to calendar-based setting changes; David explored enabling AndroidAPS functionality on a watch for times when the phone isn’t nearby; and one attendee humorously admitted he felt “tricked” into coming to a “looping conversion camp”. Tim discussed potential ways to bring recent AAPS changes into Boost, while Daniel shared how LoopFollow (designed as an iOS tool) enabled remote carb entries for Rebecca (an AAPS user). Robert spoke about a new algorithm he’s developing—heavy on the math—aiming to move away from traditional ISF. Albert noted that AndroidAPS is now sending more data to Nightscout, while Rayhan encouraged expanding that effort to support additional data types. Mike described work improving Trio’s compatibility with Medtrum pumps and refining how CAGE (cannula age) functions when using tubed systems.

Dan shared that while reconnecting at last year’s DData was meaningful, this year marked a true coming together. In a workshop, the Trio team clearly defined who they are building Trio for and aligned around a shared purpose. Despite working in a highly distributed way, it quickly became clear that everyone has the same goal. Dan also noted that while the community can sometimes feel split between iOS and Android, events like the Hackathon- last year’s, and especially this years- show the reality: one community, one shared goal.
Some efforts centered on making tools easier and safer for users. Theresa and Saira worked on a project to simplify settings testing, offering an approach far safer than asking ChatGPT.

The session closed with a heartfelt moment from Theresa, who recalled the apprehension she felt during the iAPS fork, worried that it might fracture the community. Instead, she found shared vision, generosity, and a collective willingness to say yes. “The collaboration seen this weekend,” she said, “is proof that this community continues to move forward together.”

Thank you again to our many contributors to the Fundraiser and to the many developers and support team who traveled to Vancouver to help unite the developer community. A BIG outcome from the event is MOMENTUM and new periodic online meetings of developers from across the globe to keep it going.

## Interoperability for the Win

Mike used 5 different pumps with Trio in the span of 2 weeks. He reports:

* **MiniMed 722** — The pump I've been using for the past couple years with the 7-day Extended infusion sets.
* **Medtrum Nano 200U** — Got my hands on one at HackDiabetes25 and tried it out for one patch to gain some insight into its use in Trio. It uses a 90º steel cannula.
* **Omnipod Eros** — My Nano expired at work, which was hectic, so I brought an old Eros pod because it'd be quicker to switch to than setting up a MiniMed. Like MiniMeds, it requires a link device like an OrangeLink to connect to a phone.
* **Omnipod DASH** — I still had 4 hours left in the grace period on my Eros when it gave a 052 error. I left my MiniMeds at home because I was planning on switching to it when I got home from work, but luckily, I keep a few spare DASH pods at work just in case for emergency situations (like no AAA batteries or my MiniMed or OrangeLink breaks).
* **MiniMed 723** — Picked one up at HackDiabetes25 and switched to it as my daily pump after the DASH expired, as it can bolus in smaller increments than my 722 (0.025 U vs 0.1 U).


**Bonus: Tandem Mobi** — Looking forward to switching to this in Trio sometime next year, but will probably give it a short test run with AAPS before the end of this year.


> Not used by Mike but these also work with Trio: Some Diabecare Dana pumps, a few more old MiniMed pumps, and the Medtrum Nano 300U.

## ADA Standards of Care 2026

“Both the Loop and OpenAPS algorithms [this includes Trio] offer direct management of algorithm aggressiveness through conventional pump settings. Therefore, it is advisable that health care professionals understand and offer support in tuning settings for these safe and effective technologies.”


Read about the ADA’s continuing support for OS-AID in [Diabetes Technology: Standards of Care in Diabetes—2026](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/49/Supplement_1/S150/163922/7-Diabetes-Technology-Standards-of-Care-in).

## OS-AID-Friendly Healthcare Provider (HCP) Resource Hits 400

Speaking of supportive healthcare professionals, our [List](https://www.loopandlearn.org/hcp-recommendations/) just hit 400 entries! Thank you to all who have contributed to this valuable resource, and please keep the referrals of your OS-AID-friendly HCPs coming! If you have surgery and the surgeon supports your use of OS-AID during surgery, please add them to the list, too.

## No Manual Time Changes on Phones

To ensure your looper doesn't change their phone's date/time to bypass restrictions or trick a game, you should lock the Date & Time settings.

Most people can lock the Date & Time settings on the looping phone with the following steps:

1. Go to iPhone Settings
2. Select Screen Time
3. Scroll down to Lock Screen Time Settings row
4. Enter a passcode

Make sure to record the passcode.

Confirm this is working by going to Settings, General, Date & Time.  The `Set Automatically` slider should be enabled and inaccessible. That means you cannot change the time on the phone. If you don't see that, keep reading.

If you want more detailed instructions, head over to LoopDocs: [Force Automatic Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#force-automatic-time).

If you configured your child's phone using Family Managed Settings, the instructions are more complex. Head over to LoopDocs [Automatic Time for Managed Phones](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#automatic-time-for-managed-phones).

## 15-Day G7 Help

Are you using a 15-day G7 sensor in OS-AID?


* These sensors are approved by the FDA but your pharmacy might have trouble getting them
* If you do use them with an OS-AID app, you might find it tells you the sensor is no longer available at 10.5 days
* We are working on a more elegant solution of asking the G7 device for its characteristics, but in the meantime, there is a customization you can add if you are fortunate enough to get your hands on a 15-day sensor


The link below takes you to the Issue for the G7SensorKit. The main comment at the beginning is all you need. It shows what you see if you don’t make the change and then explains how to customize for either Browser Build or for Mac-Xcode build.

## Insulin Reminders

> (Tina will add to this when making Canva version, probably.)

- Insulin is good long after expiry- many months- don’t toss it out unless it’s cloudy!
- If Insurance isn’t helping you get a good price on insulin, seek out coupons from manufacturers!
