## Version 3.4 of the *Loop* App Released!

The long-awaited [Loop 3.4](https://www.loopandlearn.org/2024/07/13/loop-3-4-release/){:target="_blank"} is here! Since the release of Loop 3.2 in March of 2023, many [new features and bug fixes](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/version/releases/#loop-v340){:target="_blank"} were added to the `dev` branch, and now they are live in `main`. Pete Schwamb announced the release on 13 July 2024. Please wait for a week or more to update to 3.4, to allow time for any bugs to be discovered and resolved. Some browser builders have encountered build errors when building Loop 3.4. If that happens to you, help can be found [here](https://www.loopandlearn.org/2024/07/13/loop-3-4-release/#check-upstream-and-keep-alive){:target="_blank"}.

Because Loop `dev` just became Loop `main` (3.4), and Loop is under steady innovation, the `dev` branch (now 3.5) will be updated very soon.

* All Loopers who are not actively engaged in developing or testing the *Loop* app should be using `Loop-main`. 
* Users who build with the Browser Build method should make sure their default branch is set to `main` in GitHub to avoid unexpected updates

If you use Browser Build, this is a good time to ensure that you turned off automatic installation from *TestFlight* on the phone - you should choose a good time to update. See [Disable Automatic Install from *TestFlight*](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-deploy/#disable-automatic-install-from-testflight){:target="_blank"}.

**A very grateful “THANK YOU” to our Loop developers and testers, who work tirelessly to continuously improve Loop for all of us!**

## Updates for the *LoopFollow* App

 Another [*LoopFollow*](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/) update is here! What’s new:

* Show eventual BG value and loop status for Trio
* The info table “Pred.” is renamed to “Min/Max”; it displays the minimum and maximum values of the predictions
* Correct the DeviceStatus Download Count and Dynamic BGData Download Limit:
    * This bug fix reduces unnecessary data downloaded from Nightscout from around 68kb to 1kb
    * If your Nightscout site has glucose data uploaded from Loop/Trio in addition to glucose from Dexcom, all data will be downloaded and displayed, even when more than 1 day is selected
* Required updates:
    * Enable Browser Build to continue working
    * Update security


## Glider - Make Diabetes Fun

> This game is only available in the US at this time

*Glider - Make Diabetes Fun* is a fresh and free app that turns your diabetes *management into an interactive game. Our team discovered it at D-DATA in Orlando last month and several members have been enjoying doing battle and learning how it works since then. They are also giving feedback to the app’s developers.

Each player feeds their CGM data to the app and it groups players each week into a league based on previous glucose levels. In the league, it pairs two players for a daily "battle". There is also a weekly buddy feature, where you and your buddy can help each other achieve a daily in-range goal. Here’s what it looks like at the start of a week and during a “battle”. Glider is available for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glider-make-diabetes-fun/id6448941297) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgmme.app&pli=1) users!
