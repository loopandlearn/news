## Upcoming Open Mics 

Our next Open Mic is on Saturday, Oct. 25, and we’d love to give a special shoutout to Trio users -and those who are curious about Trio- to join us for this one! Of course, that doesn’t mean anyone else is left out; everyone is always welcome and invited!

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) virtual meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month and the fourth Saturday of each month.

There is also an 
Italian `Open Mic` on the last Tuesday of each month for iOS and
Android loopers (with Patrick Sonnerat for
AAPS).

## iOS 26: Please Wait 

Please do **NOT** update your OS-AID phone to iOS 26 yet, and
be sure to keep iOS automatic updates off for both *Loop* and *Trio* apps, so an update won’t happen when you’re not looking!

- - -

## Don’t Lose Your Bolus Button

This has been a big issue lately because lots of people aren’t getting the message:

* iOS 26 requires Loop v3.8.0 to be able to manually bolus
* Loop v3.8.1 fixes a few more iOS 26 issues
* A few other issues regarding changing Therapy Settings with iOS 26 are not yet fixed

Be sure your Loop app remains fully usable by waiting to update iOS until our team gives the “all clear”.

**Check our [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/) page and [subscribe to this newsletter](https://www.loopandlearn.org/newsletter-signup/) before updating anything that will impact your OS-AID app!**

- - -

## Release 3.8.1 for *Loop*

Version 3.8.1 for the *Loop* app was released on 23 September 2025; see details [here](https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace/releases/tag/v3.8.1).

* Restores the designed behavior of tapping on the bolus line to automatically replace the recommended value with zero
* Adds updates to DanaKit
* Restores going to Dexcom G6 app (for users of G6) when tapping on glucose in main screen
* Additional translations added

> Loop now requires iOS 16.1 or newer.

## Did You Sign? 

A new [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/) needs to be signed by 23 October. Go there now and sign if you haven’t already!

If you need help, post in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN), [Loop Zulip Chat](https://loop.zulipchat.com/), or [Trio Discord](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE).

- - -

## Time for a Change 

Standard Time begins on:

* 26 October for Europe
* 2 November for the US

Be sure to use your app to [update the clock on your pump](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/loop-3/displays-v3/#time-zone) at your convenience. Keep your phone on automatic time.

- - -

## Automatic Build Times 

We are in the process of modifying when the **planned** weekly checks and monthly builds are scheduled.

The *LoopFollow* and *Trio* apps are already changed to the new build schedule. This change will eventually propagate to other apps in the Open-Source ecosystem.

The system will check for updates every Sunday.

* If there are no code changes, the build is skipped, except . . .
* On the second Sunday of the month, a build is always attempted

## LnL Team Members Meet in Person

September brought something truly special: two long-awaited LnL family meetups on two continents! Priscilla and Carol’s family gathered in Florida, while Miroslava and Tina’s crew met up in the heart of Italy. Though miles apart, both moments shared the same magic: laughter, connection, and the wonder of finally turning familiar names and faces on screens into real-life friends. The kids hit it off right away, proving that the LnL spirit runs strong across generations!

If you meet up with other Loopers or Trio-ers, please share your pix with us!
