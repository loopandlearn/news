## iOS Update

iOS 18.6.1 and 18.6.2 were tested and cleared by our mentors.

Both of these minor updates run the OS-AID apps just fine. But check the state of 
* iOS Software Update - make sure it is still set to Download only
* TestFlight automatic update - all the TestFlight apps on one mentor's phone were modified to enable Automatic Updates to the phone from TestFlight
* Be sure to restore the settings so that updates happen when you are awake and can check the state of your looping phone after the update completes

## Saturday `Open Mics`

We had another great discussion at Saturday’s `Open Mic` (on 23 August 2025). Thank you to all who attended and welcome to our new members and attendees! These Open Mics were added to our schedule at a time that we hope is more appealing to our Australian friends than our Tuesday ones. So join us, Aussies!

## Hackathon ‘25 Fundraising

The devs are doing it again! This fall, a dozen or so of us will gather in Vancouver, BC for another meeting of the minds to work on refining the apps we use for diabetes management. We are excited to see what will come out of this year’s “Hack” and invite you to help support it with your generous donations to Nightscout Foundation. Last year, over 100 people from around the world helped raise over $25,000. Here are details about the success of last year’s event. Please thoughtfully consider contributing to the success of OS-AID by contributing to our fundraising efforts.

## The Gossip Column

### iPhone 17 & DASH Warning

The rumor is the iPhone 17 will be available for preorder on 12 September 2025, after *Apple* makes their announcement on 9 or 10 September. All loopers should be very careful about upgrading your looping phone until you have gotten the “all clear” from our testers. As a reminder, your looping phone is a medical device and should be treated accordingly. Version testing, including hardware updates, are announced on [our website](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/), on Facebook, here in the newsletter and on Instagram.

**DASH** loopers (this means Loop, Trio, TAI, iAPS, etc) all should wait. The new Atlas (InPlay BLE) DASH pods are being manufactured and they are likely to show up in your pod supply soon. There is **no known** solution to the difficultly these pods exhibit with iPhone 16 hardware. The issues are difficulty pairing the pods initially (just keep hitting retry) and the delayed reconnection after each disconnect. 

> We have filed a Feedback form with *Apple*, but we have no further information.

### Meal AI and `Loop`

Word on the street is that a Food AI feature has come to `Loop`. 

While a new experimental Food AI customization is available, we want to emphasize that it is not in the regular script for building `Loop` and is not in the released version of `Loop`. 

Additionally, `Loop and Learn` is not the place to get support for this experimental feature- at least not yet. [Support can be found on `Loop` Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/144182-development/topic/New.20Feature.3A.20Food.20Search.202.2E0.20for.20Loop!.20.232329). If and when this feature becomes an official part of the `Loop` ecosystem, you will definitely hear about it here, in our Facebook group, and on our website.

There are also links about this proposed feature on the [`Loop` Features in Development page](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-features-in-development/#food-search).

### *Dexcom* Alerts

Check your *Dexcom* alerts section for a settings change. A setting seems to have been added during a recent update (version 2.10.0). Now there are “sound”, “vibrate”, and “match phone settings”- which could be either vibrate or sound. The alerts got reset to defaults, which are very loud. Each alert volume needs to be set individually, so be sure to set yours to a volume you prefer and do it when no one else is around to be annoyed.

### Bubble Prevention

Butch Weaver, a pilot and fellow looper on Zulipchat, recently shared his[method of purging](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/144111-general/topic/Omnipod.20Filling/near/417687714) pods of bubbles and dissolved gas when filling. If you’ve ever had unexplained BG lows a couple of hours into an airline flight, or highs soon after landing, dissolved gas may have been the reason.

## Exciting AAPS News!

AAPS can now be built with Browser! We were excited when the Browser Build debuted for `Loop`. And Trio. The excitement has spread all the way to the Android platform!

## Pro Tips: Where do you wear your Pod?

Age, skin flexibility, and body composition all influence which locations (arm, leg, abdomen, etc.) and orientations (such as having the cannula facing up, down, or sideways)  work best for each individual. As we’ve often shared, placing a piece of medical tape on the skin beneath the cannula area before applying the pod can help stabilize the cannula where it enters your skin: this can reduce leakage and may extend wear time. For added security, you can also use an overpatch -or simply place another piece of medical tape over the pod itself.

Another consideration is activities the wearer may be planning to engage in. For example, a person who is going backpacking may want to avoid abdominal placement so the hip belt will not dislodge the pod or cause discomfort.

## `LoopFollow` 3.2

This update brings one of the most requested features to `LoopFollow`:

* Remote Control for `Loop` (via Apple Push Notifications)
    – Send carbs, boluses, and overrides directly to `Loop` from `LoopFollow`
    – Uses One-Time Passwords for security (with protection against re-use within the app)
    – [`LoopFollow`Docs](https://loopfollowdocs.org/remote/remote-control-overview/) updated with full details on Remote Control

* Bugfix: The missed readings alert is now working again
* Other updates:
    – Browser build updated to Xcode 16.4 (fixes browser build failures)

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases) for more details.

Big thanks to everyone contributing, especially Daniel Mini Johansson for his work on `Loop` Remote Commands

## US Persons - Advocacy Campaign

This is the copy of the letter folks in the US should respond to.

URGENT ADVOCACY CAMPAIGN for US MEMBERS

SUBJECT: COMPETITIVE BIDDING CTA

TAKE ACTION NOW: The deadline is Friday, 29 August 2025

* [https://www.diabetespac.org/act-now](https://www.diabetespac.org/act-now)

The US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed a competitive bidding program for CGMs and insulin pumps, and aims to classify these devices under a rental program under Medicare. The proposal would have significant impacts on patients with diabetes in the United States: insulin pumps and CGMs would become rented equipment.

#### What's proposed?

* Patients would rent their devices instead of owning them.
* Patients may have to return their devices before getting a new one, risking interruptions in care that could be dangerous.
* The number of diabetes equipment suppliers is being whittled down from hundreds to somewhere between 2 AND 9 national suppliers, drastically limiting choice and creating coverage gaps.

There is no indication that this program would save beneficiaries money as proposed.

This starts with Medicare—but private insurance always follow. If passed, this will affect ALL of us.

#### Who does this affect?

The proposed changes would directly threaten access for Medicare patients; however, these changes also have the potential to impact cost, access, and choice in diabetes technology for individuals under commercial insurance and Medicaid coverage.

#### What does DPAC think?

Instead of complicating access, CMS should update outdated pump coverage rules — which have remained unchanged for 20 years — and strengthen education benefits like Diabetes Self-Management Training.

#### How can I take action?

DPAC made the process simple: using the link above, submit their pre-written letter with any of your additional comments to CMS by Friday, August 29, 2025.

The [Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC)](http://Diabetespac.org) is an alliance of people with diabetes, caregivers, patient advocates, health professionals, disease organizations, and companies working collaboratively to promote and support public policy initiatives to improve the health of people with diabetes. DPAC seeks to ensure the safety and quality of medications, devices, and services, and access to care for all 38 million Americans with diabetes.

## Skin Reactions to Diabetes Devices in People of Color

Researchers at Stanford are tackling the issue of reactions to adhesives on CGM and insulin delivery devices. If you are an adult who wears one or both of these devices, please participate in the study, follow this [link](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dpB591gqLnreOeW). Even if you are not a person of color, you can complete the survey for the study’s comparison purposes. It’s quick and easy to participate.

## Journey Awards

We have reported [previously](https://loopandlearn.github.io/news/edition/2025-04-07/?h=journey+awa#journey-awards) on Children with Diabetes (CWD) awarding Journey Awards for people who have lived with type 1 diabetes for 10, 25, 50, and 75 years. We are excited to share that at Friends for Life (FFL) Orlando in July, CWD introduced its 5-year Journey Award! This award is particularly special as it means that relatively young children can now receive Journey Awards. Our friend Reese received his, and it was truly meaningful.

You don’t need to attend an FFL event to receive your Journey Award—though it’s always fun if you do! If you’ll be at an upcoming FFL gathering, you can pick up your award there without advance notice. Not attending? No problem! If a milestone is coming up, just request your Journey Award, and it will be mailed to you.

## T1D to 100 at ADCES

A recent session led by Dr. Nancy Allen, Dr. Christina Whitehouse, and longtime T1D advocate (our own) Joanne Milo challenged the idea that age should limit access to advanced diabetes technology. The speakers emphasized that safe and effective use depends on ability, support, and adaptability—not age. Dr. Allen highlighted age-related challenges such as reduced dexterity, sensory changes, and cognitive decline, noting that these should be treated as design and education challenges rather than barriers. She pointed to strategies like simplifying device interfaces, repeating training, and involving caregivers. She also referenced the ADA Standards of Care and the “4Ms” framework (mentation, medications, mobility, and what matters most) as tools for integrating technology into age-friendly care systems.

Joanne brought a powerful personal perspective, reflecting on her 60+ years with T1D and the life-changing role of CGM, remote monitoring, and Loop technology. She argued strongly against removing older adults from technology, calling it a critical safety net. She shared practical supports such as pump checklists, infusion site tips, tailored alarms, and trained caregiver networks, and described her role in building peer communities like `Loop and Learn` and the soon-to-be-launched [T1Dto100.com](https://T1Dto100.com). 

Dr. Whitehouse reinforced the importance of tailoring solutions, sharing a case study of a 72-year-old with arthritis who succeeded with pump therapy through small adaptations like magnifiers and quick-reference guides. 

Together, the panelists showed that with thoughtful support and flexibility, technology can reduce risks, improve independence, and significantly enhance quality of life for older adults with diabetes. 

[Close Concerns](https://www.closeconcerns.com/) shared an in-depth description of the presentation.
