## Upcoming Open Mics 

Our next Open Mic is on Saturday, Sept. 27, and we’d love to give a special shoutout to Trio users -and those who are curious about Trio- to join us for this one! Of course, that doesn’t mean anyone else is left out; everyone is always welcome and invited!

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) virtual meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month and the fourth Saturday of each month.

There is also an 
Italian `Open Mic` on the last Tuesday of each month for iOS and
Android loopers (with Patrick Sonnerat for
AAPS).

## iOS 26: Please Wait 

iOS 26 has been newly released and needs to be tested for compatibility with Loop before our experts can recommend upgrading your phone to it. They have already been working hard to do this.

Issues that have been addressed include:
* the ability to bolus (Loop only)
* the ability to add non-pump insulin (Loop only)
* display issues (buttons that should have been blue were changed to grey, making them less visible) (Loop only)
* toolbar allows background to be tapped instead of round icons (Trio)

The combination of iPhone 17 and iOS 26 may create new unanticipated issues, as well.

Please wait until our experts give you the all-clear to update your looping phone- and remember: it’s a medical device. 

Typically, *Apple* will have rapid updates and bug fixes. It's worth waiting for iOS 26.1 to be released.

## Xcode 26 

Xcode 26 has been released for Mac-Xcode builders using Sequoia, macOS 15.6, and higher.

## `Loop-main v3.8` is Released 

This release:

* supports iOS 26 (although it is not recommended to update to iOS 26 yet)
* adds support for Dana-i and DanaRS-v3 pump models
* updates translations and converts to String Catalogs


If you used the Dana customization with v3.6.x, you'll need to remove it before updating, since it's incompatible now that Dana has been added to main.

See [Release Notes on GitHub](https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace/releases/tag/v3.8.0).

## Save the Date  

We have an inside perspective on [Sequel’s new twiist AID system](https://www.twiist.com/), which employs an earlier iteration of the Loop algorithm, and we’re excited to share it with the community! This session will highlight real experiences from people who have transitioned from Loop to twiist, along with practical tips for anyone considering (or preparing for) that switch. (NEED DATE We’re targeting mid-October. I’d like to do it before the 20th or if not, then November)

## Hackathon ‘25 

Calling all developers interested in improving open source DIY diabetes tech! It is our pleasure to invite you to join us at [#hackdiabetes25](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/hackdiabetes25)!
This year, the Nightscout Foundation has partnered with D-Data to offer 2 sessions. First, we will brainstorm and plan in virtual sessions on November 7. Then, we will meet in person in Vancouver, BC on November 15-16 to put that development to work at the hackathon!
If you are interested in attending either session or both, please fill out this [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemFZwPE7-nfrUc99uE1Eo-Vh1mYRzWvRYqnazBfmrKMVS7MQ/viewform?usp=header&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExOEFLbUppNmtJZGlyUDZydgEeK11myTrj-HzyIzfx9aysZhlRssz9JLevDEOTE_OGaneXn-nal_3-97yFHOM_aem_L9q_Q7Vz3CVMkqMWS_GvKA)

If you aren’t a developer, but you want to support the hackathon, anything you give will help cover hackathon and developer travel expenses. Donate here: [Nightcout Foundation: Direct Donations for Hackathon](https://nightscout.squarespace.com/new-products/direct-donation-apa26).

## Did You Sign? 

Folks who didn't sign their [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/) by June 24th are near the end of their last successful 90-day build. Their apps will die sometime on or before Sept 22nd.

## Request for Translators

Are you tired of seeing parts of your app in English and parts in the language you choose to display?

You can help.

* For the *Loop* app, all translations are handled through [lokalise](https://app.lokalise.com/projects)
* Even if you use the *Trio* app, the translations for the CGMs, Pumps and Services components are also handled via lokalise

To assist, send a DM to Marion Barker in either [Loop zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com/) or the [Trio discord server](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE). She will add you to the lokalise team.

* Include your email and the language(s) you can translate

## Time for a Change 

Daylight Saving Time begins on:

- 28 Sept. for New Zealand
- 5 October for parts of Australia

Be sure to use your app to update the clock on your pump at your convenience. 

Keep your phone on automatic time.

Coming soon: Europe and the U.S. will resume Standard Time on 26 October and 2 November, respectively.

## ICYMI: Medicare is Changing Access to Diabetes Tech in the U.S. 

26 September 2025, 10 AM PT ⎈ 12 PM ET

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed shifting diabetes technology, such as insulin pumps and CGMs, to a rental model for patients in the U.S.
This would require PWD to return their devices before receiving new ones and reduce access points for pumps and CGMs nationwide.
We are all invited to join DPAC as they bring together experts in the policy and medical fields to discuss the potential impacts of this proposal and how we can navigate them.

## PWT1D (Person with T1D) Athlete Highlight 


One of our young loopers recently placed 6th in a Special Olympics event! She’s a shining reminder that type 1 doesn’t have to hold you back.

Living with T1D comes with challenges, but also victories worth celebrating. Do you have a success story you’d like to share?  Let us know!

- - -

## T1Dto100.com is Here! 

After MUCH research and many discussions, a new website for T1Ds that’s all about aging has launched: [T1Dto100.com](http://T1Dto100.com)!
 
Joanne Milo invites you to browse the site, share your stories, questions, and requests for webinars by experts in the field of aging and T1D. Input is welcome, and please share this information with T1D groups, friends, and healthcare providers.
 
T1D to 100 is a new space created by and for people with Type 1 diabetes who are navigating the realities of aging—seeking support, sharing insights, using tools to feel more prepared, and living well.
 
They are here to provide trusted information—from practical tips and tools, long-term planning solutions, insights for emotional wellness and coping, to real-life stories that lift you up and help you navigate the uncertain path of aging. They also raise our voices to help researchers and healthcare professionals better understand what is needed for improved care and quality of life.


The new, comprehensive website, [T1Dto100.com](http://T1Dto100.com), is open 24/7, just like Type 1 diabetes!
 
Connect to others in the group on [Facebook](http://Facebook.com/groups/T1Dto100),  [Instagram](http://Instagram.com/t1dto10), and/or on [LinkedIn](http://LinkedIn.com/company/t1dto100).
