## Fingersticks are Your Friend

We were recently reminded of the importance of doing fingersticks in conjunction with getting a new CGM sensor up and running. One of our members trusted and dosed according to what she thought was a resonably high CGM reading, based on what she had recently consumed. A while later, she found that her CGM reading was actually almost 10X what her real blood glucose level was and had an emergency on her hands. Thankfully, she remained safe! Many CGM users report never doing fingersticks, but we ask you to rethink that, even if only after starting new sensors, as they often come online reading incorrectly. 

Read this post on Facebook in [CGMitC Off Topic #T1DIY](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CGMITCOFFTOPIC/posts/1964328303964178/) for more details and to see some excellent advice. Our friend was also concerned about this issue impacting the DIY community, which was very gracious of her. We want everyone to be both safe and able to keep using your preferred system: DIY or Commerical!

## Use Unique Times for Remote Carbohydrate Entries

Any caregiver remotely entering carbohydrates needs to be aware of how *Nightscout* decides what carbohydrate treatments are unique. If two entries are made with the same hour: minute: second eating time, *Nightscout* keeps only one of the entries. 

The *Loop* app handles the entries as unique so there can be a mismatch in what the Caregiver sees in *Nightscout* compared to the Looper's actual meal history. 

When adding a second remote carbohydrate entry for the same meal, increase the time for that entry by one minute. This will ensure that *Nightscout* keeps both of entries. For more details, [see this explanation](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/remote-commands/#use-unique-times-for-remote-carbohydrate-entries).
