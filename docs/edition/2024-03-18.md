## _<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;Settings Review using *Nightscout*

We had a series of Zoom sessions in which Kenny Fox analyzes *Nightscout* reports for various people to assist them in analysing the settings they use for their *Loop* app. These sessions are being recorded and made into very nice productions with timestamps. The first of these is available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LoopAndLearn){:target="_blank"}. These will be a great resource for all loopers!

## Website Page Highlight: Version Updates

Every time *Apple* pushes out an [update](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/#ios-updates){:target="_blank"}, at least one person on Facebook asks if it’s safe to update. We always recommend waiting to do so until our Guinea pigs - er- testers have given the “go ahead”. When that happens, it is quickly posted in our Facebook group, and the [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/){:target="_blank"} page of the website gets updated. It is often quicker to learn the answer to the “update” question by checking in these places than by waiting for an answer to a posted question.

## Thanks from *Anubis*

We have suggested [*Anubis*](https://www.facebook.com/groups/247952672307306/posts/1901312990304591/){:target="_blank"} transmitters to members many times in the past, and here is a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/247952672307306/permalink/1916422362126987){:target="_blank"} thanking the community for sending in Dexcom transmitters for conversion to *Anubis*. *Anubis* has a 50-minute warmup period and extends the life of sensors without restarting, saving users time, money, and annoyance. Please help keep the makers of *Anubis* supplied with transmitters. [Here’s where you can send your Dexcom transmitters](https://www.loopandlearn.org/anubis-mailing-address/){:target="_blank"}. They can be G6, *G7, or One, and can be expired and even have their batteries drained.

* G7-*Anubis* transmitters are not available for use yet - they are still in the development phase. Both used and unused G7s are needed for testing.
