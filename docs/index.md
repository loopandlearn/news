## Alert: Using Browser to Build the *Loop* app?

This only affects the &nbsp;<span translate="no">LoopWorkspace main branch</span>.

> There is a different issue for the&nbsp;<span translate="no">dev branch</span>&nbsp;that only affects you if you have to update your certificates. There is a solution for that too. We'll post about that next week.

Apple reported a change that may affect your Browser Build starting 29 April 2024.

* As of 29 April 2024, we have not heard of failures of&nbsp;<span translate="no">main branch</span>&nbsp;browser builds to deploy to TestFlight
* Don't bother with this procedure until it either happens to you or we report that it is required
    * This issue only impacts&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop main</span>_, not&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop dev</span>_&nbsp;or any&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop related</span>_&nbsp;apps
    * This link walks you through the steps: [_<span translate="no">Loop main Browser Build</span>_](https://www.loopandlearn.org/2024/04/27/testflight-april-29-2024/){: target="_blank" }

!!! important "Check your Distribution Certificate for your expiration date"
    Check the expiration date for your Distribution Certificate. If it’s soon, you should build now. Then you will have 90 days to renew your certificate.

    You can use the [Renew Certificate](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/#renew-certificate){: target="_blank" } section to check the expiration date. Just use the link in the first step. If your certificate is still valid but will expire soon, you should build without deleting the certificate.

## Conference Report: _<span translate="no">ATTD2024</span>_

> Thanks to Miroslava Calegari and Deniz Cengiz, “dedoc voices” and LnL team members, for their meeting notes, summarized here.

The 17th Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) conference, held from March 6th to 9th in Florence, Italy, showcased the latest innovations in diabetes management with a record attendance of over 5,300 participants from 96 countries.

Co-chaired by Tadej Battelino of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, the conference emphasized patient needs, including the importance of language in provider-patient communication, and discussed hot topics like stem cell therapy and type 1 diabetes prevention. Early detection, especially in Italy, which initiated the world’s first antibody screening program this year, was also topical. A big highlight was the presentation of a consensus position statement on DIY systems, which aligns with that of Italian Scientific Societies. Efforts to bridge gaps in diabetes technology access and affordability were also highlighted, and immunotherapy, type 2 diabetes, women’s diabetes issues, and interoperability were also discussed.

In terms of technology, the integration of pumps and `CGM` (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) into one device and non-invasive glucometers capable of detecting glucose in breath samples were of interest. It will be interesting to see which of these innovative technologies will become mainstream! There is an expectation of achieving a fully closed-loop commercial system in the next 3-5 years, with `CGM` being pushed as the standard of care for every person living with diabetes (PWD). Similarly, GLP-1/SLGT-2s are being promoted, but there is growing concern that long-term use might have downsides, and when PWD stop using them, they often experience more pronounced issues than before using them.

There is still a huge gap in professionals’ understanding of PWD and the significant mental burden associated with it. Efforts such as the UNLOK educational program, along with the introduction of more AI tools and learning programs for healthcare professionals, aim to bridge this gap. Additionally, the Diabetes Technology Expert program, presented by Dr. Inge Van Boxelaer, a certified diabetes instructor and endocrinologist, is/will be available in 30 languages. It offers free learning modules focusing on open-source AID systems: AAPS, Loop, and iAPS. We appreciate Dr. Inge's outreach to our Loop and Learn community for feedback and consultation. Miroslava Calegari, a member of our team, revised the *Loop* module of the Program.

## Help Us Help You with Translation

> There's a translate link on each website we support. It uses the Google automatic translation service.

If you are a non-native English speaker and are stuggling with any of our content, here’s a great suggestion from one of our developers:

Open two copies of the “how to” page, one in English and one in your native language. Use the English version for opening links and checking identifier and App Group name spellings, and the other one to assist in understanding.

If there are sections where the translation is garbled, let us know. By rephrasing the English we can improve the automatic translation.

If your language isn't there - let us know. If Google supports it, we can add it.
