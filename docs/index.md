Our next Open Mic is on Thursday, December 11. Everyone is always welcome and invited!

## Reminder for Loop Browser Builders

You need to manually build your *Loop* app once a month. (We still don't know why. Only the *Loop* app is automatically disabling itself after each manual build.)

Go to Actions for your GitHub fork (example below is for docs-test username)

* [https://github.com/docs-test/LoopWorkspace/actions](https://github.com/docs-test/LoopWorkspace/actions)

* `Build Loop` -> Enable Workflow -> Run Workflow

Let's keep those *Loop* apps working over the holidays!

## Thanksgiving Day Game Plan

Our friends at [TCOYD](https://tcoyd.org/) shared a [great plan](https://tcoyd.org/2025/10/thanksgiving-and-diabetes/) for successfully managing diabetes throughout Thanksgiving celebrations. Protein, exercise, fiber, prebolusing, and more are included. Check it out- and also check out tips on [our website](https://www.loopandlearn.org/thanksgiving/) and in [our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2161109864145506/search/?q=thanksgiving), including a carbs list for popular Thanksgiving foods!

And remember... a plan like this is useful for ANY day!

## iOS 26 and Xcode 26

Since the release of 26, we've been testing and researching, and each day brings changes to what works. It's safe for Loop, Trio, LoopFollow and LoopCaregiver users to [update to versions](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/) as high as iOS 26.1 and Xcode 26.1.1. 

We've researched the most commonly used CGMs and report on the CGM manufacturers' recommendations as well as the iOS versions that have been successfully used, but as always, if you update beyond what your CGM manufacturer recommends, replacements may be denied. Sub-versions such as .x are okay. For simplicity, in the chart, we've used the highest released version such as iOS 26.1 rather than iOS 26.

## Sharing Data with Diabetes Cockpit

From the beginning, the open-source community has used real-world data to push diabetes technology forward. The more data we have, the better we can build these systems to meet our needs. Want to help? Download the [Diabetes Cockpit app in the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/diabetes-cockpit/id1580577116), and opt in to Community Support:

* Tap on the icon at upper right for your app settings
* Scroll near the bottom and enable `Community Support`

Your data can drive innovation by giving our developers the information they need to make the algorithms more efficient and effective.

All donated data will be held in an exclusive repository and will only be used for open-source DIY innovations.

BONUS: You get access to all the cool features in the Diabetes Cockpit app for seeing correlations with your Apple Health data and your OS-AID diabetes data!

## Hackathon 2025 Highlights

This year’s Hack began with a day of virtual presentations and gatherings, hosted by [DiabetesMine's](https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine) **Amy Tenderich**. We used Remo for the meeting and several of us from Loop and Learn helped facilitate conversations at “tables” within the platform during the interactive sessions. The speakers  generously agreed  to share their presentations with the greater community. They can be found here, in the [Hack playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfnu6D6qjfHvPesExxFo9OrgEKDwUn0Ec) on Loop and Learn’s YouTube channel.

We had two opportunities to converse with Hack participants through open mic Zoom sessions! People from around the world got to chat with innovators who gathered in Vancouver, BC the weekend of 14-16 November. We could feel the excitement, especially on Sunday!

We want to say thank you to the many contributors who donated in excess of $42,000 to make this Hack and the innovation that will continue because of it. YOU make a difference!

Look for more details about what happened at Hack '25 in the next edition of News from Loop and Learn!

## Bringing Open-Source Innovation to Slovak Diabetes Education — on World Diabetes Day!

Congratulations to our Loop and Learn team member Miroslava Calegari, co-author of the new edition of *Diabetes: Tips & Tricks* — a continuation of the 2013 classic *Diašlabikár* by Peter Herceg, written for parents of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

Launched on World Diabetes Day 2025, this edition guides across more than 400 pages, from the basics and classification of diabetes through treatment, nutrition, emotional support, and everyday life — all the way to current research, new therapies, and open-source technology.

Thanks to Miroslava, the latest edition introduces stigma-free open-source AID systems and the Loop & Learn community into the Slovak diabetes education landscape for the first time — bridging science, empathy, and lived experience.

> “The future belongs to those who are not afraid of innovation —
and to children who, thanks to modern technology, can grow up freely and fully.”

Families of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes can receive the printed book for free. Each pediatric diabetology clinic in Slovakia also receives one copy for the doctor and one for the nurse.

## Many Thanks

Here are a few of the many “thanks” directed at our mentors for all the wonderful help they give
loopers. And thank you for taking the time to express your appreciation!

* Need to publicly thank Carol
for having the patience with
me to get Loop working.

* I am so beyond grateful for this
incredible community, for the cleverness
and selfless hard work that you’ve all
put, and keep putting, into this platform.
And - more selfishly - for fate to have
put enough of you intelligent and
generous diabetics out there in the
world for there to be a platform that I
can benefit from in this way. Thank you
for your minds, and for all the ways in
which you’ve helped me build and crisis
manage over the last year.

* Big thank you to Alison.
She helped me get my
Nightscout running. For 2
years I couldn’t figure it
out. Such amazing caring
people in the group.

* Thank you Theresa for
all your help getting
me to this point. I
NEVER thought this was
possible in all these
decades of struggling.

* OMG amazing! So
much easier to use in
the same app without
having to go to LCG.
Thanks, everyone! 

* Heartfelt thanks to the
developers and team who
made this possible. Loop has
improved so much in the 3
years I have been looping.
Sending gratitude to those
who have generously shared
time and expertise to
continually improve Loop.

* ...Our family life would not
be the same without Alison
and all the amazing people
working so hard behind the
scenes to make our lives
easier. Never ever do I take
that for granted. Not all
super heroes wear capes...

* The thanks all go to
Marion and Jonas.
They had to scramble
this morning... aren’t
the developers great?!

* Thank you all for your help and
suggestions and, above all,
thank you to ALL the Admin and
Dev people; Carol, Alison, Teri
and Dylan for your help this
weekend. Thank you, from
myself, and on behalf of the T1D
part of the Human Race!
