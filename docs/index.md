## iOS Version Update

**iOS 18.4** has been tested and given the thumbs-up by our team.

* This update turns on Automatic iOS updates;

## The `PBM` Problem - Insurance Roadblocks to Care

[George Huntley](https://www.diabetesleadership.org/who-we-are#leadership){:target="_blank"} is a founding member of the [Diabetes Leadership Council](https://www.diabetesleadership.org/){:target="_blank"} (DLC), a 501(c)
(3) organization, and currently serves as CEO of both the DLC and its affiliate, the [Diabetes
Patient Advocacy Coalition](https://www.diabetespac.org/){:target="_blank"} (DPAC), a 501(c)(4) organization. He has lived with T1D since
1983 and has three other family members also living with T1D. A passionate advocate for
people with diabetes, George is a past National Chair of the Board of the American
Diabetes Association and currently serves as Treasurer of [Children with Diabetes](https://childrenwithdiabetes.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Join us on 22 April as George explains the role and evolution of the Pharmacy Benefit
Manager (PBM) and the impact of the PBM’s practices on patients. We'll explore the hidden
drivers of drug prices, utilization management techniques that delay access to care, and
other significant PBM market practices. Both commercial plans and the Medicare Part D
model will be discussed. This session is specific to our US members, but all are welcome. It
will be recorded.

## Do, Don't and Other Tips

### A User Recommends Browser Build

One of our Loopers enthusiastically
recommended [browser building](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/bb-overview/){:target="_blank"} in a recent
FaceBook comment:

> “I am so happy that I
managed to browser build `Loop` and related
apps! I’m so mind-free now! Xcode build
was my first go but every time I had to
check/ wait for updates (macOS , Xcode),
dread that disk space wouldn’t suffice, my
Mac mini would not get the latest updates
and so on! Now I build `Loop` from an old
laptop!!” 

We agree.

### Do Not Rely on Answers from AI

We’ve previously shared our concerns
about relying on AI for settings decisions
when `looping`—and we still stand by that.
Now we need to add: please don’t use AI
for building information either. It can lead
to serious safety issues. We’re all eager
for the day AI can safely lighten the
`looping` load, and we’re watching its
progress. But it’s not ready for this role.
Your safety and the integrity of your OS-
AID come first. For now, stick with trusted,
human-verified resources.

### Bluetooth Signal Loss in a Crowd

You may encounter signal loss,
leading to a red `loop`. Two great pieces
of advice from our experts on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/diytrio/permalink/1798332747567239/?rdid=ZnGTTsJnNNY7tIOy#){:target="_blank"}:

1. Turn off WiFi on your phone.
Bluetooth and WiFi use the same
antenna and there’s going to be a
lot of noise in that frequency band.
2. You can solve this issue by putting
the phone right next to the pod,
then shielding it from the other side
with something that blocks
Bluetooth. 
    * You can use bodies
to sandwich the phone against the
pod with a person on either side.
    * You might also be able to shield
using a sheet of aluminium foil or a faraday bag 

### Is Your "Go Bag" Ready

What’s in your diabetes bag? Have
you looked lately? This is a friendly
reminder (from someone who
knows how important it is) to check
your or your kid’s diabetes bag on a
regular basis and make sure
everything you may need is in it!

### A Look at `LoopDocs`

Getting a new phone? That can be
exciting, but also a little nerve-wracking.

Take a moment to read up on what
to do to keep on `Looping` in [`LoopDocs`: New Phone Tips](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/new-phone/){:target="_blank"}!

### `Trio` Tip

If you add manual glucose in Trio and would like to force a `loop`, you can do so as follows:

1. Open the history and tap upper right to add manual glucose. 
2. After adding it, long press
the `loop` status ring and if Trio has enough information, it will `loop`
    * Depending on the size of the gap, you may need to enter several readings before Trio will make a decision
    * If your glucose is higher or lower than you expect, take manual action

## News from `ATTD`

Several members of the `Loop and Learn` team, as well as others we all know from the
community, attended the [Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes](https://attd.kenes.com/scientific-program/){:target="_blank"} (ATTD)
conference in Amsterdam as [#dedoc° voices](https://www.dedoc.org/){:target="_blank"} recently. Thanks to Miroslava Calegari and
Theresa Hastings for sharing these nuggets of information from the conference.

A new blood glucose range was born at ATTD: [“TING,” Time in Normoglycemia](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomas-danne-81694917_attd2025-activity-7307694868103884800-2MKK){:target="_blank"}. It is
suggested to use TING instead of TITR (Time in Tight Range) for Continuous Glucose
Measurements. There is an ongoing discussion about whether TITR (70-140 mg/dl) will
remain the standard or if we should move to 63 - 140 mg/dl, which got the majority vote,
so far.

It's always a joy to see people receiving their Journey Awards, beautiful mementos for
anyone living with diabetes for 10, 25, 50 and 75 years. CWD assumed the honor and duty
of awarding these treasures from Lilly Diabetes, who still funds them, starting a few years ago.
CWD awarded over 1500 of them last year and about a dozen at ATTD 2025. If one of those
big milestones is approaching for you or for a T1D you love, be sure to request your
[Journey Award](https://childrenwithdiabetes.com/cwd-journey-award/){:target="_blank"}!

Data from the [CLOSE IT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10882371/){:target="_blank"} trial, which evaluated an open-source, fully `closed-loop` (FCL)
insulin delivery system using the oref algorithm, were presented. The trial aimed to assess
the safety and efficacy of a bolus-free, fully automated system. In the study, the FCL
system was compared to a hybrid `closed-loop` (HCL) approach, both utilizing an Android-
based artificial pancreas incorporating a Dexcom CGM and Ypsomed pump.

In the FCL arm, no manual boluses were administered unless CGM glucose exceeded 270
mg/dL for more than one hour. In contrast, the HCL arm required meal announcements
and carbohydrate counting.

FCL was found to be non-inferior to HCL in achieving Time in Range (TIR: 70–180 mg/dL).
Both groups experienced low rates of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), with the FCL group
benefiting from a significantly reduced bolus burden. Neither arm imposed dietary
restrictions.

A heartfelt thank-you concluded the presentation, honoring David Burren, also known as
[Bionic Wookiee](https://bionicwookiee.com/){:target="_blank"}, for his pivotal contributions as a software engineer in the development of
open-source diabetes technologies. His work continues to shape the future of automated
insulin delivery.

An [insightful poster](https://www.facebook.com/1166328317/posts/10235978041529156/){:target="_blank"} explored the lived experiences of women with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
navigating perimenopause and menopause — a topic that still lacks sufficient research
and clinical guidance. The study revealed that 88% of participants reported that
menopause had an impact on their diabetes management, with many experiencing
increased insulin resistance, glycemic variability, and emotional distress. However,
technology played a significant role in improving outcomes; women using continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) and artificial insulin delivery (AID) systems experienced better
glucose control and overall well-being. Additionally, access to Menopause Hormone
Therapy (MHT) was linked to improved outcomes. The study calls for better integration of
diabetes care, gynecology, and mental health services to support midlife women with T1D.

Ten members of the diabetes
community, including LnL’s
Theresa Hastings, gathered to
draft the first version of the
[Diabetes Data Rights Charter](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/diabetes-data-rights-charter_attd2025-diabetes-attd2025-activity-7310083493558968320-wYSQ){:target="_blank"}.
They created and shared an
informative poster and
request feedback and
contributions from the wider
diabetes community. Please
join the conversation and
share your thoughts!

## What is `dedoc`?

It’s a global network of diabetes
advocates making sure the patient voice
is heard where decisions are made. The
dedoc° voices program gives people
living with or loving people living with
diabetes the chance to attend top
conferences and speak up! Several of our
most active members have been part of it
— now it’s your turn. To apply to be a
dedoc° voice, see [dedoc.org/voices](dedoc.org/voices){:target="_blank"}!
