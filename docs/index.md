## *Dexcom* G7 App Recall

[A bug in V2.7.0](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/dexcom-g7-ios-continuous-glucose-monitoring-cgm-app) can cause the app to stop updating glucose values. G7 users using this version should update their G7 apps- but it seems that 2.8.0 also has the bug.

If you're on 2.6.0, stay there for now.


## Dealing with Low Glucose?

When you feel low glucose (hypoglycemia) coming on, or when your glucose is already low and you need to raise your blood glucose efficiently, do you reach for juice or a snack food option? This [article by Dan Heller](https://danheller.substack.com/p/the-best-way-to-treat-hypoglycemia) is a long read, but a good one.

We encourage you to put in the time! Here are some important points to whet your appetite:

Some quotes from the article are provided below:

> The primary benefits of using dextrose in the mouth include:

> * Bypassing your intestines assures that these carbs will be absorbed as quickly as feasible.
* Dextrose is in and out of your system- fast. Once absorbed, you’re done. There’s no risk of extra carbs that will get absorbed later, leading to the roller coaster.
* Speedier absorption makes it less likely that your counter-regulatory system kicks in (assuming it’s working). Hence, you’re less likely to get the roller coaster effect (or if you do, it’ll be much more mild).
* Because tablets only contain 4g each, it’s harder to over-compensate by eating too much. This is good, because, more often than not, you don’t need as much as you think (though the panicky feeling doesn’t make you feel that way). The limited speed in which you can consume tablets (using this technique) helps limit over-compensating. Now, instead of ravenously wolfing down that box of Girl Scout cookies you’ve been eyeing, you’re being slowed down by a more direct and sensible method.

## iPhone Recommendation

We want to [remind](edition/2025-02-24.md#ios-version-update-and-recommendation){: target="_blank" } you that if you are on an iPhone X or older, you
should be looking to upgrade. Apple's next Worldwide Developers Conference
(WWDC) is on 9 June and we anticipate the release of iOS 19.0 in September 2025.

Additionally:

* LoopFollow will soon require devices that support iOS 16 or newer
* Trio will soon require devices that support iOS 17 or newer

> All hardware that supports iOS 16, also supports iOS 17 and iOS 18. It is best to go on and update your phone to the newest iOS.

## *Trio* Talk

### *Trio* Documentation Update

The *Trio* documentation has been updated!

This documentation is for the beta testing branch of Trio. If you plan to test prior to the official Trio 1.0 release, please review this documentation in preparation for testing the beta version of Trio. The new docs are still under construction and can be found at [https://docs.diy-trio.org](https://docs.diy-trio.org).

You can still find the documentation for the current version of Trio (Trio 0.2.5) in the new docs. They are located under the “0.2.x” tab or here: [https://docs.diy-trio.org/0.2.x](https://docs.diy-trio.org/0.2.x)

This documentation is a work in progress, so please understand that they are still being built out and that some things will change as we continue through beta testing.

### "Soon" is Almost "Now"

The *Trio* open beta is almost here!


Once the beta is public, anyone who
wants to install and use it can, but here is
guidance on who we think should:


* If you've been using Trio for a while
now (or another oref-based AID like
AAPS, OpenAPS, Boost, iAPS, etc), we
recommend you update to the beta
once it's available.

* If you don't have any experience with
Trio or other oref-based AIDs, we
recommend you hold on a little
longer. While we don't expect any
major bugs, it would be much harder
for someone who isn't familiar with
how things are supposed to work to
realize if something doesn't work
properly. While you wait, give the new
Trio Docs a read, especially the
[startup guide](https://docs.diy-trio.org/configuration/new-user-setup/).

Much more information can be found at these announcements in [Trio Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1020905149037813862/1239980484318986341/1371241765113430128) and [Trio Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/diytrio/posts/1840249870042193/).

## A Look at `LoopDocs`

New to Looping? We always recommend reading the documentation!
There’s a lot to read. Here’s a good place to start- the Overview section in
[LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/intro/overview-intro/)! You can dive into different linked sections at your own pace
and return to this page and click on the next when ready.

## Nurses Appreciation Week

> May 6-12 is Nurses Appreciation Week

If you’re visiting your endocrinology clinic or know a school nurse
who supports your child with type 1 diabetes, this is a great time to
recognize their care and dedication.

To all of our nurse
friends: **thank you for everything you do to keep people safe,
supported, and well- whether in diabetes care or otherwise!**
