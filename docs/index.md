Our next Open Mic is on Tuesday January 8. Everyone is always welcome and invited!

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) virtual meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month and the fourth Saturday of each month.

There is also an 
Italian `Open Mic` on the last Tuesday of each month for iOS and
Android loopers (with Patrick Sonnerat for
AAPS).

## iPhone 17

If you received a new iPhone 17 as a gift or you
randomly decided to treat yourself to a new phone,
please read the [updated LoopDocs instructions](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/new-phone/) before
migrating to your new phone. You'll want to update to
Loop 3.8.2 on your old phone (if you haven't already)
before updating to your iPhone 17 with iOS 26.x.


Most browser builders have already updated, but some
Mac-Xcode builders are still on Loop 3.4 or 3.6. If you
are on Loop 3.4 or 3.6 and you update to iOS26, you will
lose your ability to manually bolus until you update to
Loop 3.8. Avoid the drama and rebuild first.

## Help for `Loopers`using GLP-1RA Meds

Here’s a Pro Tip that may help `Loopers`
using GLP-1RA medications!


Add the [Profiles customization](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-features-in-development/#profiles) and name
your profiles after the medication level so
that you can track changes- and easily
revert if the medication dosage reverts
back to a previous level.

More tips when adding a GLP-1RA:

* Adjusting your carb absorption rate is necessary
* Keep that glucagon handy - low treatments might not absorb as quickly

## #BeyondtheNumbers

We have a great series of looping-related
Resolutions shared on `Loop and Learn` Instagram and Facebook. If we take them to
heart, we will become more informed
loopers and experience more
predictable outcomes, with less need
for intervention. Be sure to check
back over the next week!

Look for the hashtag: #BeyondtheNumbers

Resolution #1:

> This year, I'll give myself the chance to build my own #OpenSource app with help from the community; because understanding is part of safety.
