## iPhone Recommendation

Device Recommendation

We want to remind you again that if you are on an iPhone X or older, you
should be looking to upgrade. Apple's next Worldwide Developers Conference
(WWDC) is on 9 June and we anticipate the release of iOS 19.0 at that time.


Additionally. LoopFollow will soon require devices that support iOS 16 or newer.

## *Trio* Documentation Update
## A Look at `LoopDocs`

New to Looping? We always recommend reading the documentation!
There’s a lot to read. Here’s a good place to start- the Overview section in
[LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/intro/overview-intro/)! You can dive into different linked sections at your own pace
and return to this page and click on the next when ready.



## Nurses Appreciation Week

> May 6-12 is Nurses Appreciation Week

If you’re visiting your endocrinology clinic or know a school nurse
who supports your child with type 1 diabetes, this is a great time to
recognize their care and dedication.

To all of our nurse
friends: **thank you for everything you do to keep people safe,
supported, and well- whether in diabetes care or otherwise!**
