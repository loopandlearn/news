## Insights on Women's Health from `ATTD` 2025

This special edition of News from Loop and Learn spotlights top
insights on women’s health from [ATTD 2025](https://attd.kenes.com/) sessions. Thank
you to Miroslava Calegari for weaving these insights together
and to Dawn Adams for contributing her research. 

Historically, research often ignored sex differences. Greater
awareness can help reshape priorities and foster more inclusive,
effective care. Understanding sex-specific factors means
challenging outdated assumptions and building care that’s truly
personalized.

Several sessions underscored the need to tailor diabetes care to biological sex and
hormonal changes across the lifespan. These insights aren’t just relevant for women—
they matter to everyone involved in diabetes care: clinicians, educators, partners,
parents, and researchers.

Men have an important role to play, too. Diabetes doesn’t happen in isolation—it unfolds
within relationships, families, and teams. Recognizing how menstruation, pregnancy, or
menopause affects glucose and insulin can lead to better support and reduced stigma.

> Who should
read this?
>> Everyone.

> A lot of women get excited to see men caring for babies. We get excited to see men in
the diabetes community talking about glucose differences during menstrual cycles!

## Updates on Diabetes Management and Female Health

Differences in sex and gender are fundamental in diabetes care. They play a crucial role in
everything from cardiovascular risk and metabolic function to how people use wearable
technology. To improve outcomes, diabetes care must embrace the full range of diversity in
sex, age, and individual experiences. This session brought together five speakers. 


### Leveraging Technology to Address Gender Differences in Diabetes Care

> Dr. Eda Cengiz

Critical disparities in diabetes care exist, one of the most
alarming of which is that women with type 1 diabetes face a 40%
higher risk of early death, increased rates of stroke and other
severe complications. Yet diabetes treatment remains largely
“one-size-fits-all,” with care that rarely accounts for women’s
health needs except during pregnancy. Most studies still don’t
report sex-specific data, limiting progress in personalized care.

Dr. Cengiz highlighted tech tools like smart rings designed for women and MedRing, an
app-controlled intravaginal ring that collects data and delivers medication.

> “We can’t treat what we don’t understand.” Without better gender-specific data,
even the most advanced tools won’t meet women's needs. Closing the gender data gap
is essential for making diabetes care smarter, more precise, and more equitable.

### The Role of Estradiol in Glucose-Insulin Homeostatis

> Dr. Lia Bally

Dr. Lia Bally highlighted the important role of the hormone
estradiol in metabolism. It boosts insulin secretion and
sensitivity, enhances GLP-1 function, curbs appetite, and raises
energy use. Despite its relevance, most research is based on
animal models, with limited studies involving women with
diabetes. Bally stressed that hormonal changes from
menstrual cycles, menopause, or contraception significantly
affect glucose management. For example, estradiol dips have been linked to increased
hypoglycemia in insulin pump users, though automated systems can help. She called for
better hormone monitoring, more inclusive clinical trials, and more advanced tools to
close the gender gap in diabetes care.

> “We still have strong patient voices calling for better tailored support 
—even with AID.”

### Impact of Sex on the Control of Type 2 Diabetes

> Dr. Chiara Fabris

Clinical evidence shows that females typically have a lower
risk of cardiovascular disease. However, when it comes to
T2D, women fare worse compared to men. They tend to have
higher A1c, LDL cholesterol, and BMI. Unique health factors,
such as gestational diabetes, PCOS, early menopause,
thyroid issues, and different responses to medication, further
increase their risk. Despite these known differences, women
are less often offered recommended treatments and tend to
face more challenges with long-term medication use. This
highlights the urgent need for sex-aware treatment
guidelines and precision medicine to address the unique
risks women face in T2D.

> We really have a need
for precision medicine
for treatment and
treatment guidelines
that take, into
consideration sex
differences.



### Sex Differences in Diabetes Management in the Primary Care Setting

> Dr. Natalie Bellini

Women with T2D are less likely to receive recommended
screening and treatment in primary care, including lower
rates of metformin use, statin therapy, and lipid screening.
They experience more adverse drug effects (such as
gastrointestinal issues with metformin), have a higher risk
of hypoglycemia due to metabolic differences, and face
added challenges from caregiving demands and missed
meals. The benefits of integrated, cross-specialty care,
education, and the positive influence of peer support
groups like DiabetesSisters in improving health outcomes
were emphasized. Bellini urged us to “act today.” We can’t
wait for primary care—if we see the problem, we need to
act. We can’t just manage insulin pumps—we need to
address blood pressure, lipids, weight, and real-life
challenges, too.

> Ignoring factors like metabolism, hormonal shifts, autoimmune disorders and medication side effects is really not okay.


### Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Risk Factors

> Dr. Darja Šmigoc

Women with T1D have significantly higher cardiovascular risks
than men, especially if diagnosed before age 10, and may lose up
to 18 years of life due to early atherosclerosis. Key risk factors
include traditional ones such as hyperglycemia, hypertension,
albuminuria, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as well as psychosocial
and behavioral factors. Although many of these risks are highly
preventable, they are often under-recognized and undertreated.

In a Slovenian study, we see that by 2016, with the use of insulin
pumps, the gender gap in HbA1c disappeared. However, the girls
still had a less-than-optimal lipid profile. Šmigoc stressed the
importance of biomarkers like Apolipoprotein B and C-reactive
protein in early atherosclerosis.

Most cardiovascular risk is preventable, yet interventions often
begin too late or are insufficient, particularly in young women.
Starting primary prevention early with gender-specific strategies
is crucial to address this serious health disparity.

> Further studies are
needed to help update
guidelines — especially
since women have
historically been
underrepresented in
cardiovascular trials.

## Menstruation and Diabetes

Although women with diabetes report changes in glucose control across
their menstrual cycle, this area is dramatically underrepresented in
diabetes research and technology development. This spotlight on Carson
Wedding’s work demonstrates that the same behaviors can lead to very
different glycemic outcomes depending on the hormonal context.
Carson’s work represents a powerful blend of scientific curiosity, technical
innovation, and lived experience — exactly the kind of voice the diabetes
community needs more of.

### Using Cycle-Based Pattern Analysis To Improve Insulin Dosing For Women With Type 1 Diabetes

Carson Wedding, an undergraduate
researcher with type 1 diabetes—and
daughter of Nightscout Foundation’s James
Wedding—presented a standout project
exploring how the menstrual cycle impacts
blood glucose outcomes. Motivated by
personal challenges in managing her own
diabetes, Carson sought to uncover
patterns in glucose, insulin, and food intake
data that shift with hormonal changes
across the menstrual cycle

Using a model she developed, based on a method called Block Recurrence
Quantification Analysis (Block RQA), she identified behavioral patterns in diabetes
management data and examined how these patterns varied between menstrual
phases, especially the follicular and luteal phases. Her most striking finding: glycemic
risk increases by nearly 200% during the luteal phase. She also found that meals
without a bolus were significantly more likely to cause hyperglycemia during this time.


These insights offer critical evidence for something many have long suspected, but
few studies have explored in depth: hormonal fluctuations can dramatically alter how
the body responds to the same diabetes management strategies. Carson’s work lays
the groundwork for more advanced, individualized diabetes technologies that account
for hormonal context. Her project highlights the value of combining lived experience
with scientific inquiry- and brings attention to an area that deserves much more focus
in diabetes research and technology design.

## Pregnancy and Diabetes

Here we highlight sessions on technology use by pregnant women with
diabetes. Current Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) technologies may not fully meet the unique needs of
pregnancy, and their effectiveness relies heavily on timely initiation, clinical
support, and equitable access. Starting  AID early in pregnancy can make a
meaningful difference- and it’s effective!

### Review of Trials

Dr. Helen Murphy spotlighted ten key studies from over 4,000 diabetes-related
publications of the past year, focused on pregnancy in type 1, type 2, and gestational
diabetes. Two major randomized controlled trials evaluated hybrid closed-loop (HCL)
insulin delivery systems: the AiDAPT trial (CamAPS FX system) & the CRISTAL trial
(MiniMed 780G). Real-world data reveal that not all HCL systems perform equally in
pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of both the technology and how it’s used. While
new tools hold enormous promise for improving outcomes, successful implementation
depends on clinical expertise and equitable access, not just the devices themselves.

### Medtronic AID

Medtronic AID were compared to
MDI in Spain. Prof. Rosa Corcoy
shared challenges: off-label use,
often introduced later in gestation,
and typically reserved for more
complex cases such as individuals
with elevated HbA1c or additional
health conditions. Variations in
clinical practice and access made
outcomes harder to assess
consistently.

### CRISTAL Trial

Dr. Katrien Benhalima shared results of
the CRISTAL trial - the first trial to
assess Medtronic’s 780G system in
pregnancy. It was shown to be safe and
well-received, with better overnight
glucose control and fewer low blood
sugar events than standard insulin
therapy. The most significant
improvements were seen in individuals
new to automated insulin delivery and
those starting with an HbA1c under 7%.

### Guidelines for Glucose Control in Pregnancy

Dr. Yariv Yogev emphasized that clear guidelines for blood sugar control in
pregnancy, especially with gestational diabetes (GDM), remain a challenge.
Definitions of “well-controlled” vary, and most studies rely on indirect
markers like HbA1c, with less than 1% reporting actual glucose data, limiting
real-world relevance. Higher or unstable glucose levels have been linked to
large birth weight, preeclampsia, and birth defects. Experts suggest using
CGM and data from healthy pregnancies to guide targets, aiming for <105
mg/dL with minimal variability. Obesity during pregnancy increases insulin
resistance and risk, even without a diabetes diagnosis, and often overlaps
with GDM, making care more complex.

## Perimenopause and Menopause in Diabetes Care

Dawn Adams shared her insights- she is a midwife and part of the [#dedoc°
voices program](https://www.dedoc.org/voices)- an international initiative that brings lived experience into the
heart of scientific conversations. At events like ATTD, voices like hers help
uncover missing pieces in diabetes care, in this case, especially for women
navigating under-discussed phases such as perimenopause and menopause. 

More in-depth information from Dawn Adams can be found [here](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/living-with-diabetes/your-stories/type-1-managing-menopause-with-hrt-dawn).

### The Use of Diabetes Technologies During Perimenopause and Menopause in Women with Type 1 Diabetes

Despite widespread preparation for pregnancy
in girls and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D),
menstruation and the transition through
perimenopause and menopause- inevitable
stages- receive far less attention and support.
As hormone levels shift, many women
experience increased insulin resistance and
glucose variability. Diabetes technologies such
as continuous glucose monitors (CGM), insulin
pumps, connected pens, and automated insulin
delivery (AID) systems have revealed critical
gaps in education, guidance, and research
around these life stages.

Symptoms of menopause, such as fatigue, hot flashes, mood swings, and weight gain, often overlap with or mask dysglycemia, complicating diabetes management. While technologies offer personal insights into how hormonal changes, physical activity, dietary adjustments, and menopause hormone therapy (MHT, formerly known as hormone replacement therapy, HRT) affect glucose control, few formal studies and no agreed-upon recommendations exist. A small global study of 90 women with T1D in menopause showed that many reported decreased insulin sensitivity and reduced time in range, despite using CGM and/or AID. MHT was seen by many as helpful for both glucose stability and psychological well-being.


Women from underserved communities or with lower incomes faced even more challenges. Many didn’t have access- or had limited access- to diabetes technology, menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or healthcare providers who understood their needs. These missing pieces made it harder to manage diabetes and left many women feeling stressed and unsupported.


To improve outcomes, there is a clear need for integrated, culturally sensitive care
that bridges endocrinology, gynecology, and mental health. Incorporating
menopauseinto diabetes care pathways- as has been done with pregnancy-
could improve health, longevity, and quality of life for women with T1D during
midlife and beyond.
