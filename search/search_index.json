Here are some things to consider when making that choice.</p> <ul> <li>Open-source (OS) technology has opened new doors for diabetes management, offering innovative, customizable, and cost-effective solutions. </li> <li>Open-source automated insulin delivery (OS-AID) systems empower people with diabetes to take more control over their care and attain better outcomes. </li> <li>Adopting a new OS-AID solution requires careful evaluation to ensure safety, reliability, and long-term usability</li> <li>With increasing numbers of options, how do you choose?</li> </ul> <p>When considering an OS-AID technology, assessing its reliability and accuracy is essential. Diabetes management relies on precise and consistent data, so any tool must be rigorously tested. Seek out and critically evaluate peer reviews and community feedback that validate its accuracy in tracking blood glucose levels, insulin dosing, and other key metrics.</p> <p>A crucial factor when considering an OS-AID is community and developer support. A strong, active developer community is vital for maintaining and improving OS-AID tools. Investigate whether the project receives regular updates, has thorough documentation, and fosters an engaged user base with responsive support forums. A well-supported app is less likely to become obsolete or vulnerable to security risks.</p> <p>Ease of use and integration can make or break an OS-AID technology\u2019s effectiveness. The tool should fit into your diabetes management routine without requiring extensive technical expertise. If it does not sync with your current devices, such as CGM, insulin pumps, or health apps, weigh the potential benefits against the effort required to make adjustments.</p> <p>Regulatory compliance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014is another important consideration. Unlike commercial diabetes management tools, OS solutions lack FDA or other regulatory approvals. This does not mean they are unsafe (although some could be), but it does place personal responsibility on the user to ensure accuracy and safety. Extra caution should be taken when using OS-AID technology, as errors could have serious consequences.</p> <p>Long-term viability and sustainability also play a role in determining whether an OS tool is worth adopting. These projects rely on volunteers and community contributions, which can lead to varying levels of support over time. While some projects thrive for many years, others lose momentum and risk abandonment. If key developers step away, updates and bug fixes may slow down or stop entirely. A project with a strong and diverse group of contributors, including developers, mentors, writers, and editors, is more likely to remain sustainable. Without ongoing updates, a tool may become obsolete, less secure, or incompatible with new devices.</p> <p>Hardware compatibility is another key factor. OS-AID solutions require specific devices, which may not be practical for everyone. Before committing to an OS-AID option, verify that it works with your current devices or that you can procure the necessary hardware to use it effectively.</p> <p>Legal and liability risks should not be overlooked. Using non-FDA-approved OS software for medical decisions, particularly for insulin dosing, could have legal implications if something goes wrong. Understanding potential personal liabilities before using such tools for critical decisions is essential.</p> <p>Evaluating user experience and accessibility is just as important as assessing technical capabilities. A powerful tool is only useful if it is intuitive and easy to navigate. Complicated installation processes, frequent updates, or steep learning curves may make adoption challenging for non-technical users. Spending time in a user community and learning about an OS-AID system before deciding to use it can help determine whether it is a good fit. It is also worth noting that some people may start using an OS-AID system and later decide it is not for them, which is completely okay. Fortunately, there are now many OS and commercial options for automated insulin delivery.</p> <p>Before adopting any new technology, consulting with your healthcare team is recommended. They can help assess whether the tool aligns with your treatment plan. While some healthcare providers are open to new technologies, and even promote them, others may be hesitant or unwilling to support patients who use OS-AID solutions. Be prepared to discuss how you plan to validate the tool\u2019s effectiveness and integrate it responsibly into your care routine. You can check for a <code>Loop</code>-friendly healthcare provider on our resource and if you have one to recommend, please add to it!</p> <p>Remember that diabetes management involves sensitive health data, so security should be considered. Open-source software is transparent, allowing users to examine its code for vulnerabilities, but that also means potential security risks if it\u2019s not well maintained.</p> <p>Open-source diabetes management technology offers innovative and cost-effective solutions, but it requires careful evaluation to ensure safety, usability, and sustainability. By considering factors like accuracy, security, ease of maintenance, and long-term support, you can make informed decisions. Remember to consult your healthcare provider before making changes to your treatment plan and choose technology that enhances, rather than complicates, your diabetes management.</p> <p>A very important and often overlooked aspect of choosing OS-AID is that the learning curve is unavoidable. Having all the features of OS-AID on your phone, and reading success stories from others in the community, it\u2019s easy to assume that great glycemic results will come quickly. However, this journey requires patience.

It's not just about one stage of diabetes, when the disease has already set in. Unlike previous conferences (ISPAD2022, ATTD2023) while speaking a lot about Stage 1 and Stage 2 of type 1 diabetes (before clinical diagnosis), this time, much attention was given to what's being called Stage 4 of diabetes - long standing\u00a0T1D.</p> </li> <li> <p>The evidence is clear: we should not simply wait for a universal solution to type 1 diabetes. There are various cures in the pipeline, and one size does not fit all.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scientists are passionately embracing the #WeAreNotWaiting mantra as well, in pursuit of a cure. The hot topics of the conference revolved around prevention, screening, immunotherapy, and beta cell replacements. DIY (Do-It-Yourself) presentations, including those by Lenka Petruzelkova (AAPS) and Katarina Braune (who, herself, is fully looped on iAPS), have become a significant part of ISPAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>The presence of people living with diabetes and caregivers under the #dedoc umbrella is now an essential aspect, both in the present and for the future.

It\u2019s a smaller conference but it focuses on the bleeding edge of diabetes technology and innovation. Over the course of two days, many fascinating presentations were given, ranging from a start-up\u2019s debut to commercial Goliaths putting their newest products on display.</p> <p>Kicking off the event was Dean Kamen. He is the inventor (1976) of the first wearable insulin pump, AutoSyringe. He also developed the iBot which led to the Segway. Other projects include the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the <code>FIRST Robotics Competition</code> and don't miss this cool advertisement created when the competition went global: FIRST Global - Not A Robot. His current projects include both mass producing beta cell lines for research and a new insulin pump that delivers in the intradermal layer instead of the subcutaneous layer which should make it faster and more efficient.</p> <p>Later in the event, there was also a presentation for a new open source CGM that reads glucose in the intradermal layer with essentially no lag time.</p> <p>Event activities also included a fashion show and crafts session with diabetes supplies and a brainstorming session about the pros and cons of real time CGM access in the healthcare realm.</p> <p>Since <code>d-data</code> was the birthplace of the #WeAreNotWaiting movement, in 2013, it was appropriate that DIY legend Ben West gave a presentation on keeping diabetes open source innovation alive. Other open source presentations included iAPS, and a new fully closed loop (FCL) system by Nascence Biomed combining an offshoot of AndroidAPS with proprietary commercial pump drivers, and Boost which utilizes heart rate and a step counter to help automate an FCL.</p> <p>As intriguing as the presentations were, though, I think the networking and meeting so many other like-minded individuals from across the DIY diabetes community was my favorite part. There\u2019s just something about being with so many other people who understand what we\u2019re all going through and who are constantly pushing for new innovations. We even went out for pizza and gelato where a whole table didn\u2019t bolus and just let their DIY system automate everything for them.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2023-11-19/#diabetes-awareness-month","title":"Diabetes Awareness Month","text":"<p>November is Diabetes Awareness Month.

Thanks to Odd Stoltenberg for permission to paraphrase his words.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Do not ignore the importance of quality of life and your psychological state - it is important not to get burned out</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not compare your diabetes results with others without considering how their lifestyle and personality may differ from yours, as well as what other treatments they may be using</p> </li> <li> <p>Treatments have to work for you (or your child), and nobody but you can say where that balance should be in life and in diabetes management</p> </li> </ul> <p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) published a joint consensus for The Management of Type 1 Diabetes in Adults. They suggest that results be measured over 3 months. Don't just consider your best or worst days. The goals are:</p> Measurement Goal Time In Range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) &gt;70% of the time A1C &lt; 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) Readings &lt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) &lt;4% of the time Readings &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) &lt;1% of the time Readings &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0  mmol/L) &lt;25% of the time Readings &gt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) &lt;5% of the time <p>When taken together, Time In Range (TIR) and A1C are considered the standard way of comparing diabetes status. There are other ways of describing results, but they have not been generally adopted.</p> <p>There are many posts by enthusiasts for particular methods who present stories that may leave out important information, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Individual physical condition and genetics can affect metabolism and how the body reacts overall to food, insulin and exercise</p> </li> <li> <p>The time the individual spent learning about the medical and technical aspects of their diabetes management</p> </li> <li> <p>The personality of the individual</p> <ul> <li>Some are more driven, some are very detail-oriented, some forget things all the time - while others do not forget a thing, some give up very easily, some get overwhelmed easily by complexity with regard to technical or medical matters</li> <li>A strict diet or always prebolusing can make diabetes management easier, but others might feel that such limitations make life less enjoyable</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Whether additional medications are used</p> <ul> <li>For example, a GLP-1 (like Ozempic or equivalent) will impact how quickly carbs get absorbed which can reduce high glucose after meals</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Any discussion stating what should be achievable can be difficult - since that often leaves a considerable number of people behind that cannot achieve what others say they should.

The specific update mentioned here is from 2.3.3 to 3.0, but this holds for all updates in the future.</p> <p>For those readers who use iAPS, please wait to update any iAPS release until experts in the community have a chance to test and confirm the release.</p> <p>Post from 10 February 2024 repeated here:</p> <p>iAPS has had a large increase in users over the last year. However, the development method has not changed. iAPS is still maintained by Jon B. M\u00e5rtensson with contributions from other developers. Jon decides when to merge code into the different branches, and he decides when to make a Main release. Jon is not on Facebook, and will not be commenting on this post. He is available on Discord.</p> <p>With the increasing number of users, some of us (including Theresa Hastings, Dan H. Moody, Tom Barrows, Mike Plante, and many more) have tried to help Jon move towards a more controlled release cycle, with peer programming, proper release testing, improved documentation, etc. Jon, bless him, spends most of his free time developing iAPS. He believes that changing the ways of work will slow down development and take away his freedom to choose what to do with the app. I believe he is right, but I still believe this is what should be done - to make sure iAPS has a level of quality that matches the increasing number of users. It's not just a few advanced users anymore.</p> <p>With the help from Kelsey Huss we also got Scott and Dana (authors of the Oref algorithm) involved, to try to find a way to move things forward in a safe manner. Still, all code from the DEV branch was merged into MAIN and released as version 3.0 today.</p> <p>The release notes are not complete. We know that this version contains several bug fixes, some design changes and some new features. That is a good thing! But we also know that this release contains code that has not been tested for more than a couple of days, and other changes that should have been tested on a broader user base before releasing to everyone - like the new bolus calculator, and new remote features.</p> <p>I believe that iAPS Main 3.0 is an experimental app at the moment. It should be used with caution, only by people who are closely following the Discord group and ready to re-build on short notice.

Fortunately, a simple and effective solution has been suggested by a user on Discord and tested by several members of our team, yielding positive results. If you're experiencing any of these problems, you can consider this method.</p> <p>The information given here is based on personal experiences and is not intended as medical advice. Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your treatment.</p> <p>Consider the fact that this method depends on inserting the cannula through a piece of medical tape attached to the skin. You may not be willing to take that action.</p> <p>The method involves placing a piece of Tegaderm or OpSite Flexifix dressing on your skin prior to applying your <code>pod</code>. Apply the <code>pod</code> directly over it without cutting a hole for the cannula. The dressing only needs to be in the area of the cannula, it does not need to be as big as the <code>pod</code>. This technique has been successful in stabilizing the cannula and preventing many of the aforementioned issues, ultimately extending the use time of the site.</p> <p>The rationale behind this approach is that it stabilizes where the cannula enters the skin, limiting motion that can lead to leaking. Several members report the site remains functional for a longer duration with more stability in day-to-day insulin needs.</p> <p>For individuals dealing with <code>pod</code> adhesive irritation, apply a sufficiently large piece of dressing to fit under the entire <code>pod</code>. Additionally, spraying Flonase on the area and allowing it to dry before applying any dressing can help mitigate adhesive-related issues.</p> <p>Some ways we can tell we have a leaky <code>pod</code>:</p> <ul> <li>Glucose is not responding to known sufficient insulin dosing</li> <li>Wet and/or discolored adhesive around <code>pod</code></li> <li>Smell of insulin</li> <li>Cannula is visually dislodged</li> <li>For some: leaking leads to bleeding and stinging with large boluses</li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-02-21/#meal-time-tips","title":"Meal Time Tips","text":"<p>When you enter carbs, the Loop app makes a meal bolus recommendation that will keep your glucose just above your Glucose Safety Limit.

Early detection, especially in Italy, which initiated the world\u2019s first antibody screening program this year, was also topical. A big highlight was the presentation of a consensus position statement on DIY systems, which aligns with that of Italian Scientific Societies. Efforts to bridge gaps in diabetes technology access and affordability were also highlighted, and immunotherapy, type 2 diabetes, women\u2019s diabetes issues, and interoperability were also discussed.</p> <p>In terms of technology, the integration of pumps and <code>CGM</code> (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) into one device and non-invasive glucometers capable of detecting glucose in breath samples were of interest. It will be interesting to see which of these innovative technologies will become mainstream! There is an expectation of achieving a fully closed-loop commercial system in the next 3-5 years, with <code>CGM</code> being pushed as the standard of care for every person living with diabetes (<code>PWD</code>). Similarly, GLP-1/SLGT-2s are being promoted, but there is growing concern that long-term use might have downsides, and when <code>PWD</code> stop using them, they often experience more pronounced issues than before using them.</p> <p>There is still a huge gap in professionals\u2019 understanding of <code>PWD</code> and the significant mental burden associated with it. Efforts such as the UNLOK educational program, along with the introduction of more AI tools and learning programs for healthcare professionals, aim to bridge this gap. Additionally, the Diabetes Technology Expert program, presented by Dr. Inge Van Boxelaer, a certified diabetes instructor and endocrinologist, is/will be available in 30 languages. It offers free learning modules focusing on open-source AID systems: AAPS, Loop, and iAPS.</p> <p>We appreciate Dr. Inge's outreach to our\u00a0Loop and Learn\u00a0community for feedback and consultation.

Carol Vachon, Ann Oxley and Melissa Holloway and hundreds of other participants had the opportunity to learn about the latest in T1D innovation. Thanks to the amazing Amy Tenderich for organizing such an important conference!</p> <p>Amy Tenderich is the Founder of DiabetesMine, a leading online information destination that she launched after her diagnosis with type 1 diabetes in 2003.</p> <p>Here are a few highlights from the June 2024 D-Data session:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ed Beccle from CGM Me presented the Glider app, which pairs you up with a different CGM user daily to compete for best time in range. It turns CGMing into a game. The LnL team has been experimenting with this app for the last few weeks. Please see our July 15 edition for details on Glider.</p> </li> <li> <p>Arjun Panesar from DDM Health delivered a fascinating presentation on using voice analysis to diagnose Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) with remarkable accuracy. Although DDM Health is based in the UK, they are working on expanding to the US, Australia, and other countries. Panesar shared that with just 250 voice samples, their AI model could diagnose T2D with 85% accuracy. Remarkably, by increasing the sample size to 1,000, the accuracy rate soared to 97%!</p> </li> <li> <p>Diana Isaacs from Cleveland Clinic  moderated a panel on alternative insulin delivery, emphasizing that many with diabetes can't access Automated Insulin Delivery and the newest technologies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deanna Bousalis from the FDA discussed interoperability between CGM, pumps, and algorithms. She highlighted how simulations and models are now being used to test compatibility, helping to streamline and expedite regulatory submissions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerous AI companies were represented. Here\u2019s a sampling:</p> <ul> <li>Milton presented their AI-powered diabetes concierge, designed to answer patients\u2019 questions about their diabetes devices and optimize their usage. In addition to device support, it also provides personalized tips for meal planning and exercise.</li> <li>Lior Eshel, CEO of MakeSense presented that their platform \u201caccurately and automatically monitors the carb content of every meal. One to watch!</li> <li>Vision \u2013 The AI software designed to assist in managing T1D and recommend settings adjustments based on Nightscout data is not ready for widespread use. While we won't delve into the debate over its status as an unauthorized medical device, it's important to note that the software's recommendations are derived from the Juicebox Podcast (JBP). The concern isn't about the quality of JBP contributors but rather about the applicability of their advice to individual T1D cases\u2014 context is crucial.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-09/#ada-84th-scientific-sessions","title":"ADA 84th Scientific Sessions","text":"<p>Tina Hammer attended the American Diabetes Association\u2019s 84th Scientific Sessions and was amazed by the vast number of presentations and speakers, as well as the sheer scale of the event. Held at Orlando\u2019s 7-million-square-foot convention center, 21-24 June 2024. She felt like she walked every inch of those 7 million square feet over the four days! ADA was a big experience and she writes that her notes just scratch the surface.</p> <p>I have been looking forward to attending the ADA conference for a few years and it was impressive! I was surprised to feel a bit intimidated the first day, with the expansiveness of it all, and with so many people scurrying around, but I settled in by the second day. Seeing and hanging out with several friends, colleagues and other people I was excited to meet helped. The Vachons even popped over from D-Data! Many of ADA\u2019s sessions had multiple speakers. They spoke rapidly, to get all they wanted to say into a short window, often of 15 minutes.</p> <p>ADA TV filmed throughout the conference. Many familiar faces can be seen in these videos. There was heavy emphasis in the areas of Clinical Diabetes/Therapeutics, Complications and Behavioral Medicine, Clinical Nutrition, Education, and Exercise.</p> <p>Next to the treat of seeing and making friends, I have to say that the highlight of ADA for me was seeing Dr. Rory Holman accept the 2024 Banting Medal for Scientific Achievement and talk about his many, many contributions to diabetes research and development. His segment starts around minute 06:00 in this video. Among these are the first finger pricking device and insulin pen and many important studies. Dr. Holman was extremely gracious in crediting colleagues and family members for their contributions to his accomplishments, which was nice to see!</p> <p>I noted a couple of general themes throughout many of the sessions I attended. Many speakers emphasized the need for increased diversity in diabetes research, both among participants and researchers themselves. This is not only for equity purposes but because diverse physiologies and backgrounds bring additional issues and insights. The other theme I noticed was the mention of the gut microbiome and its importance.</p> <p>Something really cool for me was to see two pumps I have assessed when participating in diabetes-related focus groups in the recent past: twiist, which is Tidepool\u2019s first pump partner in offering an FDA-approved (older) version of Loop, and Tandem\u2019s Mobi, a versatile little pump that has numerous impressive features. Neither of these pumps is compatible with Loop/Trio at this time. The DANA-i pump, which is Loopable, was represented too!</p> <p>Numerous talks highlighted that GLP-1RAs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) are emerging as versatile therapeutic agents, extending far beyond their original application in T2D management. Besides that and their proven efficacy in obesity treatment, we saw evidence of their potential in addressing a wide array of health conditions, including AUD (alcohol use disorder), sleep apnea, cardiovascular health, kidney function, liver health, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive function. Additionally, researchers are finding that the use of dual GLP-1RAs seems to enhance the positive effects of this class of drugs.</p> <p>The success of Teplizumab/ Tzield in delaying the onset of Stage 3 T1D and the importance of repeated screenings in high-risk populations (those with T1D family members) was emphasized. Tzield is now available in the U.S. for Stage 2 T1D patients ages 8 and up.</p> <p>ADA\u2019s Diabetes Innovation Challenge winners and finalists were announced and last year\u2019s winners were reviewed. It was thrilling to see our friends from Diatech Diabetes win the Challenge with their SmartFusion Insulin Failure Detection technology! See the video when they gave a Loop and Learn talk back in 2021.</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget AI! Studies of the use of AI in the diabetes and nutrition sectors were presented, with encouraging results. I look forward to seeing much success!</p> <p>Many thanks to all who made ADA an enjoyable experience for me!</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-09/#tcoyd-one-2024-august-meeting","title":"TCOYD ONE 2024 August Meeting","text":"<p>The ONE Conference, put on by Taking Control of Your Diabetes (TCOYD), is the ultimate conference and retreat for ADULTS with type one diabetes and their loved ones. TCOYD is a nonprofit, charitable organization that has been around since 1995.</p> <p>Thank you to LnL member Wendy Fuller for sharing these meeting highlights from San Diego, CA, 16-18 August 2024!</p> <p>For the past two summers I have attended the ONE Conference. The retreat takes place at the Paradise Point Resort in San Diego, CA every August. It\u2019s two days jam-packed with learning about all the new advancements in diabetes care, making connections with other T1s and having a lot of fun!</p> <p>The weekend starts with a sponsor lounge with all the major diabetes companies represented. You can look at, touch and talk about all the currently available tech and get all your questions answered. Exercise opportunities are available every morning and the days are packed with all types of relevant T1 breakout sessions from advanced AID systems, including Loop, to the emotional side of Type 1.</p> <p>The most unique thing about this conference is the endocrinologists and MD\u2019s that speak and participate are primarily all Type 1\u2019s themselves! These endocrinologists are some of the top researchers from all over the country and the world. They all take the time to talk with you, eat with you and share their knowledge as well as their experiences as a Type 1 themselves.</p> <p>The best part about the ONE Conference is being able to hang out with about 600 other type 1\u2019s from all over the US and even from other countries! You will make new T1 friends and learn from their shared experiences.</p> <p>As a Looper, the primary way to obtain and share information is through direct conversations with endocrinologists who also loop and by connecting with other Loopers. I suggested in the post-conference survey that the conference include more information about open-source AID systems, with specific breakout sessions on this topic. Despite this, I was able to connect with fellow Loopers, exchange insights, and expand my knowledge about our looping experiences. We learned from each other, dined together, and even danced to a fantastic Beatles cover band.</p> <p>Who wants to join us next year?</p> <p>You can view the Saturday morning lectures from the ONE conference at this link.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-09/#helpful-links","title":"Helpful Links","text":"<ul> <li>Subscribe to get the Newsletter delivered to your email weekly.<ul> <li>Not all articles in the original Newsletter are reproduced in this text only edition; click on original Newsletter archives for the full version</li> <li>In particular, articles about recent posts in Facebook are not transcribed to the text-only version</li> </ul> </li> <li>Check for Updates summarizes details about latest versions for Loop, Trio, Loop Customizations and iOS</li> <li>Find a Health Care Provider who will support your use of\u00a0Loop</li> <li>Loop and Learn\u00a0Open-Source Automated Delivery System Links</li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-18/","title":"2024-09-18","text":""},{"location":"edition/2024-09-18/#welcome-to-news-from-loop-and-learn","title":"Welcome to News from\u00a0Loop and Learn","text":"<p>Master Your DIY Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery System</p> <p>Published on 18 September 2024.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-18/#in-this-edition","title":"In this edition:","text":"<ul> <li>Zoom Sessions</li> <li>Fuel the Future: Support Hack 2024</li> <li>Advocacy at the <code>DNC</code></li> <li>Dexcom Geofencing Update</li> <li>Disable Auto Install in TestFlight</li> <li>Sharing is Caring</li> <li>Pack Your Bag</li> <li>Make Your Own Dark Mode</li> <li>Update Your Apple Watch</li> <li>Overlap Dexcom G7 Sensors</li> <li>Survey for Parents of Students with T1D</li> <li>Helpful Links</li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-09-18/#upcoming-zoom-sessions","title":"Upcoming Zoom Sessions","text":"<p>Loop and Learn: Informal Discussion (<code>Open Mic</code>) zoom meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month.</p> <p>Zoom Sessions use this link:</p> <ul> <li>https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89085412738?pwd=eXpTN2M5V3M0TEVJQktmVldBTVRYUT09</li> </ul> Topic Recorded?

He woke to a Dexcom low alarm but snoozed it for 30 minutes without checking LoopFollow, as he assumed it was a slow drop and that Trio would manage it with zero temping. Nearly half an hour later, he was awakened by an urgent low alarm. When he checked LoopFollow, he found that he wasn\u2019t looping and had been receiving scheduled basal the entire time.

People from Loop and Learn, Trio, Lotus (Nascence Biomed), AAPS teams, and developers in general- almost all of whom are \u201cnew\u201d on the open source scene since the last Hack- collaborated on making our OS-AID systems even better, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden on PWD. Groups were formed based on interest areas and people shifted groups as was reasonable. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a recap from the perspectives of some of our Hackers:</p> <p>David Burren and Tim Gunn of Nascence Biomed say:</p> <p>We analyzed the implications of dynamic ISF and discussed improvements to the onboarding process. Currently, we use basal profiles, ISF (Insulin Sensitivity Factor), and CR (Carbohydrate Ratio) settings, but these values are often inaccurate and vary considerably, even with values from doctors. To address this, we reviewed different models\u2014such as sigmoid and logarithmic functions in Trio and AAPS, along with a simplified model in Lotus. We developed plans for a more integrated approach, which we hope to test through retrospective analysis, aiming to make the system more consistent and adaptable across user profiles, regardless of gender, aging patterns, or weekly fluctuations.</p> <p>Additionally, we worked on standardizing the oref implementation across platforms, moving away from JavaScript to support a shared reference implementation rather than just a design. Progress was also made on the coding front, setting us up to deliver a more cohesive and accessible experience across platforms.</p> <p>Other groups focused on topics such as AID testing/development, Nightscout and open source sustainability.</p> <p>Theresa Hastings sums it up quite nicely, probably for all of us:</p> <p>If previous hackathons were anything like this one, I can say I now understand why this community took off like a bat outta hell years ago. The innovation that is driven through collaboration when a common goal is at the center easily becomes an unstoppable force. I felt it that day and have been coasting from the high ever since. The common theme in all of the discussions was unity. Improving the structure of DIY systems so innovations can be shared. This means we can combine our resources and share in the rewards of this hard work.</p> <p>Every day, I count myself blessed to be part of this community of innovators. For the first time, at the hackathon, I didn\u2019t feel like an imposter but felt like I was at home.

Here are some things to consider when making that choice.</p> <ul> <li>Open-source (OS) technology has opened new doors for diabetes management, offering innovative, customizable, and cost-effective solutions. </li> <li>Open-source automated insulin delivery (OS-AID) systems empower people with diabetes to take more control over their care and attain better outcomes. </li> <li>Adopting a new OS-AID solution requires careful evaluation to ensure safety, reliability, and long-term usability</li> <li>With increasing numbers of options, how do you choose?</li> </ul> <p>When considering an OS-AID technology, assessing its reliability and accuracy is essential. Diabetes management relies on precise and consistent data, so any tool must be rigorously tested. Seek out and critically evaluate peer reviews and community feedback that validate its accuracy in tracking blood glucose levels, insulin dosing, and other key metrics.</p> <p>A crucial factor when considering an OS-AID is community and developer support. A strong, active developer community is vital for maintaining and improving OS-AID tools. Investigate whether the project receives regular updates, has thorough documentation, and fosters an engaged user base with responsive support forums. A well-supported app is less likely to become obsolete or vulnerable to security risks.</p> <p>Ease of use and integration can make or break an OS-AID technology\u2019s effectiveness. The tool should fit into your diabetes management routine without requiring extensive technical expertise. If it does not sync with your current devices, such as CGM, insulin pumps, or health apps, weigh the potential benefits against the effort required to make adjustments.</p> <p>Regulatory compliance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014is another important consideration. Unlike commercial diabetes management tools, OS solutions lack FDA or other regulatory approvals. This does not mean they are unsafe (although some could be), but it does place personal responsibility on the user to ensure accuracy and safety. Extra caution should be taken when using OS-AID technology, as errors could have serious consequences.</p> <p>Long-term viability and sustainability also play a role in determining whether an OS tool is worth adopting. These projects rely on volunteers and community contributions, which can lead to varying levels of support over time. While some projects thrive for many years, others lose momentum and risk abandonment. If key developers step away, updates and bug fixes may slow down or stop entirely. A project with a strong and diverse group of contributors, including developers, mentors, writers, and editors, is more likely to remain sustainable. Without ongoing updates, a tool may become obsolete, less secure, or incompatible with new devices.</p> <p>Hardware compatibility is another key factor. OS-AID solutions require specific devices, which may not be practical for everyone. Before committing to an OS-AID option, verify that it works with your current devices or that you can procure the necessary hardware to use it effectively.</p> <p>Legal and liability risks should not be overlooked. Using non-FDA-approved OS software for medical decisions, particularly for insulin dosing, could have legal implications if something goes wrong. Understanding potential personal liabilities before using such tools for critical decisions is essential.</p> <p>Evaluating user experience and accessibility is just as important as assessing technical capabilities. A powerful tool is only useful if it is intuitive and easy to navigate. Complicated installation processes, frequent updates, or steep learning curves may make adoption challenging for non-technical users. Spending time in a user community and learning about an OS-AID system before deciding to use it can help determine whether it is a good fit. It is also worth noting that some people may start using an OS-AID system and later decide it is not for them, which is completely okay. Fortunately, there are now many OS and commercial options for automated insulin delivery.</p> <p>Before adopting any new technology, consulting with your healthcare team is recommended. They can help assess whether the tool aligns with your treatment plan. While some healthcare providers are open to new technologies, and even promote them, others may be hesitant or unwilling to support patients who use OS-AID solutions. Be prepared to discuss how you plan to validate the tool\u2019s effectiveness and integrate it responsibly into your care routine. You can check for a <code>Loop</code>-friendly healthcare provider on our resource and if you have one to recommend, please add to it!</p> <p>Remember that diabetes management involves sensitive health data, so security should be considered. Open-source software is transparent, allowing users to examine its code for vulnerabilities, but that also means potential security risks if it\u2019s not well maintained.</p> <p>Open-source diabetes management technology offers innovative and cost-effective solutions, but it requires careful evaluation to ensure safety, usability, and sustainability. By considering factors like accuracy, security, ease of maintenance, and long-term support, you can make informed decisions. Remember to consult your healthcare provider before making changes to your treatment plan and choose technology that enhances, rather than complicates, your diabetes management.</p> <p>A very important and often overlooked aspect of choosing OS-AID is that the learning curve is unavoidable. Having all the features of OS-AID on your phone, and reading success stories from others in the community, it\u2019s easy to assume that great glycemic results will come quickly. However, this journey requires patience.
